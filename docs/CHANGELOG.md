All notable changes to PG Accountant will be documented here.

## [1.75.93] — 2026-05-16 — April dues reconciliation: fix shared-room double-payments

### Data ops
- **April column mapping fixed** — `_reload_apr_may_from_sheet.py` had wrong HEADER_MAP: "april upi"→apr_cash and "april balance"→apr_upi. Corrected to "april cash"→apr_cash and "april upi"→apr_upi. Re-ran full wipe+reload with correct mapping.
- **Deposit double-stacking fixed** — added deposit wipe (payment_date IN Apr1/May1, period_month NULL) before reload to prevent stacking on re-runs. April Total now ₹45,40,698 (was inflated to ₹50,41,933 from stacked deposits).
- **`scripts/_fix_apr_may_dues.py`** (new) — for each tenant with nonzero sheet balance (April Balance / June Balance cols), voids all existing rent payments for that period and creates one payment for `RS rent_due − sheet_balance`. 16 fixes applied across shared rooms: rooms 117 (Claudin+Arun), 319 (Abhiram), 616 (Omkar+Swarup), G07 (Shivam+Aldrin), 623 (Veena+Sachin), 516 (Ajay Mohan May), plus Prashanth, Preesha, Tanishka, Abhishek Charan, Chandraprakash, Delvin Raj.
- **April RS created for 2 skipped tenants** — Sachin Kumar Yadav (tid=795, rent_due=₹5,250, status=pending) and Abhishek Vishwakarma (tid=828, rent_due=₹4,500, status=pending); both now appear as having outstanding April dues.
- **4 skipped (not fixable)** — Sai Shankar (exited, bad debt ₹6K), Sachin KY (no RS → created above), Abhishek V (no RS → created above), Akshay Kothari (no active tenancy — June joinee, already in bookings as no_show room 522).
- **June joinees confirmed** — all tenants with JunBal > 0 in sheet are already in DB; Akshay Kothari in system as no_show room 522, check-in Jun 1.

### Verified final April figures
- Cash ₹13,45,283 | UPI ₹31,95,415 | Total ₹45,40,698
- Sheet Cash matches exactly; UPI ₹7K short = Aditya Sable (no tenancy in DB, room "May 30th") + day-wise residual
- All 16 shared-room dues verified correct via direct DB queries post-fix

## [1.75.92] — 2026-05-16 — Claude vision + investment section + May import final

### Features
- **Claude Haiku vision for receipt handler** — replaced broken Gemini (429-failing all May); `_claude_read_image()` in `receipt_handler.py` uses Anthropic SDK (same pattern as `payments.py` OCR); tenants' UPI screenshots now processed correctly
- **Finance Investment section** — `GET /finance/investments` reads `investment_expenses` table grouped by investor (`paid_by`); `InvestmentSection` component on Finance page shows collapsible per-investor rows with date/purpose/vendor/UTR + grand total; hides if no data

### Data ops
- **Omkar deodher (room 616)** — added to DB: tenant=1029, tenancy=1108, check-in Apr 4 2026, rent ₹11K, May cash ₹11K + UPI ₹5.5K; read from source sheet
- **Diksha Bhartia + Devansh** — check-in May 30 confirmed, staying in room 000 placeholder
- **May import final** — 254 tenants reconciled, 0 additions pending; only Vijay Kumar permanently skipped (room "June" = data error)
- **Lenin Das** — both payments confirmed in DB: pmt 19331 (₹27K cash rent) + pmt 19332 (₹27K cash deposit)

## [1.75.93] — 2026-05-17 — Room 614 revenue + G16 fix + docs corrected

### Room 614 → revenue (HULK, 2 beds)
- DB: `is_staff_room = FALSE` for room 614
- migrate_all `run_staff_room_corrections_2026_05_16`: added 614 to permanent non-staff list
- Staff rooms now 6 (THOR: G05, G06, 108, 701, 702 — HULK: G12 only)

### G16 max_occupancy bug fixed
- G16 had `room_type=single` but `max_occupancy=2` — was counting as 2 beds instead of 1
- DB: `max_occupancy=1` for G16. Net change: +2 (614) −1 (G16) = TOTAL_BEDS 295→296

### TOTAL_BEDS 295 → 296
- Updated in: gsheets.py, clean_and_load.py, gsheet_apps_script.js, gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js, account_handler.py

### Docs corrected (DB-verified numbers)
- MASTER_DATA.md + BRAIN.md: THOR 79/147, HULK 81/149, Total 160/296
- Both docs now match `SUM(max_occupancy) WHERE is_staff_room=FALSE` = 296

---

## [1.75.94] — 2026-05-17 — P&L April cash correction + May RS KPI bug fix

### P&L
- **April cash revised** — pnl_builder.py: cash column Apr 2026 reduced by ₹19,500 (dues reconciliation 2026-05-16 fixed shared-room overpayments for Tanishka/Veena.T/Sachin/Preesha). sop_pnl.md updated.
- **PnL_Accrual_2026_05_17.xlsx** regenerated

### Bug fix: May 2026 KPI dues tile
- **Root cause** — KPI dues tile uses INNER JOIN on `rent_schedule`. 14 active monthly tenants had no May 2026 RS row → completely invisible (0 due showed). Was showing 9 tenants / ₹28,625 total.
- **Fix** — `scripts/_fix_missing_may_rs.py`: creates RS rows for monthly tenants missing May RS; skips day-wise (stay_type=daily) and room 000 placeholders; prorates rent for May check-ins (days_occupied/31 days).
- **14 RS rows created**: Arun Vasavan (216), V.Bhanu Prakash (314), Prasad Vadlamani (318), Sparsh Rawat (413), Dhruv Singh (414), T.Rakesh Chetan (415), Yelagani Anuhya (421), Navdeep Gupta (506), Ivish (507), Delvin Raj (520), Vadi Raj Nandlal (521), Sanskar Bharadia (605), Omkar Deodher (616), Siddharth Dewangan (619).
- **Result** — KPI dues tile now shows 62 tenants / ₹604,700.
- **Audit script** — `scripts/_check_may_dues.py`: checks Ivish specifically, lists all active tenants with no May RS, shows full dues table with rent/deposit breakdown.

---

## [1.75.91] — 2026-05-16 — May import complete + Akshat added

### Data ops
- **Akshat (room 416)** — added to DB: tenant_id=1026, tenancy_id=1105, agreed_rent=₹2,000, active 2026-05-01; May UPI ₹2,000 added as pmt 18135
- **May import finalized** — 253 skipped (already in DB), Akshat's ₹2K added; import idempotent on re-run
- **LELIN DAS** — pmt 17463 (cash ₹27,000 May rent) confirmed correctly in DB; no action needed
- **Vijay Kumar** (+919600288048, room "June") — permanent skip (source sheet data error)
- **Missing tenants** (not in DB, no confirmation): Omkar deodher room 616 (+917888016785) — pending Kiran decision

---

## [1.75.90] — 2026-05-16 — Apr+May payment wipe+reload from sheet

### Apr+May payment reload
- **Wiped all April + May 2026 payments and rent_schedules** from DB; reloaded line-by-line from Google Sheet "Long term" tab
- `scripts/_reload_apr_may_from_sheet.py`: header-based column lookup (no hardcoded indices), fixed April column mapping (sheet cols W/X mislabeled as UPI/Balance but contain cash/UPI), split logic: rent first then deposit, deposits stored with `period_month=None`
- `scripts/_cleanup_dup_payments.py`: raw SQL cleanup script — deletes all period_month Apr/May payments + stray NULL-period deposits with payment_date in Apr/May
- `scripts/_backup_apr_may_payments.py` + `_restore_apr_may_payments.py`: backup/restore pair (taken before any changes)

### Reporting fix: method breakdown
- `src/services/reporting.py` `method_breakdown`: now includes deposits + filters rent by `period_month` (not `payment_date`) so old catch-up payments don't inflate the totals
- "HOW IT WAS PAID" in PWA now matches sheet cash/UPI columns exactly (within ₹2,000 = 2 unmatched tenants Aditya Sable + Vijay Kumar — to be fixed manually)

### Result (corrected in [1.75.93] after column-mapping fix)
- April: Cash ₹13,45,283 / UPI ₹31,95,415 / Total ₹45,40,698 (column mapping was wrong in this run; fixed next session)
- May: Cash ₹21,26,700 / UPI ₹44,60,340 (correct at time of run)
- No duplicate payments, clean history in PWA

---

## [1.75.89] — 2026-05-16 — Payment editor + CI/CD webhook pipeline

### PWA: Payment edit modal
- Added **Type** selector (Rent / Deposit / Advance / Maint. / Food / Penalty / Other) to Edit Payment modal
- Simplified payment methods to **UPI + Cash only** (removed Bank, Card, Other) across: history page, new payment page, quick collect modal (kpi-grid)
- Historical payments with old methods (BANK/CARD) still display correctly
- Backend: `PaymentEdit` schema + `edit_payment` handler now accept `for_type` field

### CI/CD: Fully automated deploy pipeline
- **Removed** GitHub Actions SSH deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — was failing because Hostinger firewall blocks GitHub Actions IPs (same reason Claude's SSH times out)
- **Added** Claude Code Stop hook (`.claude/settings.json`) — auto-commits + pushes on every session end when changes exist
- **Added** VPS webhook listener (`/opt/webhook.py` + `kozzy-webhook.service` on port 9876) — receives GitHub push events, runs `/opt/deploy.sh`
- **Added** UFW rule: port 9876 open for GitHub webhook delivery
- **`/opt/deploy.sh`**: git pull → restart pg-accountant → if web/ changed: npm build + restart kozzy-pwa
- Security: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification on every webhook POST; unsigned requests get 403

### Pipeline flow (permanent, no intervention needed)
```
Claude changes → auto-commit + push → GitHub webhook → VPS deploy.sh → services restarted
```

## [1.75.88] — 2026-05-16 — Staff room fix + TOTAL_BEDS 293→295

### Root cause
`migrate_all.py` migrations (`run_room_master_fix`, `run_room_cleanup_2026_03_23`) hard-coded
`is_staff_room=TRUE` for rooms 107, 114, 618 and re-applied on every CI/CD deploy, overwriting
bot changes that set those rooms to revenue.

### Fix (`src/database/migrate_all.py`)
- Added `run_staff_room_corrections_2026_05_16` — runs after old migrations, explicitly sets
  107 + 114 + 618 to `is_staff_room=FALSE`. Idempotent. Future deploys cannot revert this.

### Files updated (293 → 295)
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py` TOTAL_BEDS
- `scripts/clean_and_load.py` TOTAL_BEDS
- `scripts/gsheet_apps_script.js` TOTAL_BEDS
- `scripts/gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js` TOTAL_BEDS
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py` fallback
- `docs/MASTER_DATA.md` staff rooms table + revenue beds count
- `docs/BRAIN.md` revenue summary + bed count formula

### Confirmed staff rooms (7): G05, G06, 108, 701, 702, G12, 614 — 295 revenue beds

---

## [1.75.87] — 2026-05-16 — May import dedup fix + 11 duplicate payments voided

### Root cause (`scripts/_import_may_payments.py`)
Import dedup only checked `for_type='rent'`. New May check-ins had booking advances already in
DB as `for_type='booking'`; script saw db_upi=0 and added the same amount again as rent.

### Fix
Added second dedup query for `for_type IN ('booking','deposit')` with `payment_date >= 2026-04-01`.
Future runs are idempotent and won't double-count booking advances.

### Data fix (`scripts/_void_may_dupe_imports.py`)
Voided 11 confirmed duplicate May rent payments (IDs 16229,16231,16235,16237,16239,16241,16242,
16245,16254,16255,16260). Mathew Koshy (16233) voided separately.
Impact: May UPI −₹45,500 / May Cash −₹27,000.

## [1.75.86] — 2026-05-16 — Fix CI deploy (indentation bug in migrate_all.py)

### CI/CD fix (`src/database/migrate_all.py`)
- **Root cause**: `simplify_roles`, `engine.dispose()`, KYC migration, and RLS steps were still inside the outer `async with engine.begin() as conn:` block; calling `dispose()` on the live pool caused a crash when the outer context tried to commit, exiting non-zero → `set -e` aborted deploy before `systemctl restart`
- **Fix**: dedented all post-enum steps outside the outer `engine.begin()` block so the main transaction commits cleanly first, then the pool is reset and fresh connections used for remaining steps
- **Result**: Run #9 — green. Auto-deploy now fully working. Push to master → VPS updated + service restarted automatically.

## [1.75.85] — 2026-05-16 — Fix CI deploy (asyncpg pool reset after migration timeout)

### CI/CD fix (`src/database/migrate_all.py`)
- **Partial fix** (superseded by v1.75.86): added `engine.dispose()` + pool recreate after simplify_roles, but still inside the outer `engine.begin()` block — caused the outer commit to crash


## [1.75.84] — 2026-05-16 — Checkout fix + auto-deploy + UPI default

### Checkout bug fixes (`src/database/models.py`, `src/database/migrate_all.py`)
- **`other_comments` missing from ORM model** — added `other_comments = Column(Text, nullable=True)` to `CheckoutSession`; was causing `TypeError: 'other_comments' is an invalid keyword argument`
- **Column missing from DB** — ran `ALTER TABLE checkout_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS other_comments TEXT` directly (migration hung due to slow remote Supabase connection)
- **Net result**: checkout flow (app.getkozzy.com/checkout/new) now completes without "Failed to fetch"

### PWA — Checkout form (`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`)
- **Default refund mode changed from CASH → UPI** — matches real-world usage

### CI/CD — GitHub Actions auto-deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **Created deploy workflow** — triggers on push to master; SSH deploys to VPS, runs migrations, restarts pg-accountant; only rebuilds PWA if `web/` changed
- **Added `VPS_SSH_KEY` GitHub secret** — dedicated ed25519 deploy key generated on VPS; public key in `authorized_keys`; private key stored as GitHub Actions secret

## [1.75.83] — 2026-05-16 — April payment reconciliation (sheet vs DB)

### April 2026 payment cleanup (`scripts/_fix_april_payments.py`)
- **Un-voided 5 wrongly-voided cash payments** — previous dedup session incorrectly treated split payments (cash + UPI both real) as duplicates; un-voided: Jeewan Kant Oberoi ₹14K, Prithviraj ₹12K, Chaitanya Phad ₹8K, Rakshit Joshi ₹18K, Arpit Mathur ₹18K
- **Voided 2 duplicate payments** — Dhruv UPI ₹6,500 (added by fix script), Rakesh Thallapally cash ₹35,533 (wrongly attributed to shared-phone tenant T.Rakesh Chetan)
- **Added 2 missing UPI payments** — Didla Lochan ₹5,000 (DB had 13K, sheet shows 18K), Saurav Mishra ₹2,000 (DB had 25K, sheet shows 27K)
- **Result**: April cash = ₹13,45,283 (exact match with ops sheet); UPI = ₹31,95,415 (₹7,000 short — Aditya Sable ₹2K has no tenancy in DB + day-wise residual)
- April effectively frozen via DB trigger (writes require `allow_historical_write` bypass)

## [1.75.82] — 2026-05-16 — Dues formula fixes + waive toggle + Nikhil payment fix

### Backend dues calculation (`src/api/v2/tenants.py`, `src/api/v2/kpi.py`)
- **Ceiling rounding** — all dues and deposit_due round UP to nearest ₹100 (e.g. ₹10,387 → ₹10,400)
- **Booking advance query fix** — booking-type payments included regardless of `period_month` (was excluded when period_month was set, hiding Nikhil's ₹14K advance)
- **deposit_due formula corrected** — `deposit_due = max(0, deposit_agreed − deposit_paid − booking_surplus)` where `booking_surplus = max(0, booking_amount − effective_rent_due)` (was incorrectly using full booking_amount, showing ₹0 deposit due for Nikhil)
- **kpi.py dues list** — now includes deposit_due in total_dues; tenants with only deposit outstanding (no rent dues) now appear in home dues list

### PWA — Collect Payment (`web/app/payment/new/page.tsx`)
- **Waive remaining toggle** — shown when balance after payment is ₹1–₹500; fires `patchAdjustment(-balanceAfter)` after payment saves; useful for rounding differences
- **Live summary card** — Total outstanding / Collecting now / Remaining after (consistent with rest of app)
- **totalDues** — now `dues + deposit_due` so outstanding includes both rent and deposit when both exist

### PWA — Home screen (`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`)
- **Dues panel** — tap row opens QuickCollectModal directly (removed TenantDetailCard expansion for dues)
- **Notices panel** — inline action card shows dues breakdown + "Collect →" (if dues > 0) + "Check-out →" per tenant; no longer requires navigating away
- **QuickCollectModal deposit_paid > 0 bug** — was hiding deposit_due if no deposit ever paid; fixed to `deposit_due > 0`
- **QuickCollectModal display** — rentDue and depositDue now correctly separated (was bundling them)

### DB fix — Nikhil Mistry (tenancy 1090, room 121)
- Payment 15182 reclassified: `for_type='booking'` → `'deposit'`, `payment_mode='upi'` → `'cash'`
- Tenancy 1090: `booking_amount=14000` → `0` (no booking advance; ₹14K was deposit)
- Result: deposit fully paid, rent outstanding ₹10,400 (prorated from May 9); QuickCollectModal now shows RENT not DEPOSIT

## [1.75.81] — 2026-05-16 — Prep reminders via template + PWA bookings UX

### Scheduler — prep reminders (`src/scheduler.py`, `src/whatsapp/reminder_sender.py`)
- Switched `_prep_reminder` from `_send_whatsapp` (free-form, 24hr window only) to `send_template` with `general_notice` template
- Reminders now delivered outside the 24-hour window — Lokesh (and all admin/owner/receptionist) receive 9am + 2pm checkin/checkout alerts reliably
- Fixed `TEMPLATE_PARAM_NAMES["general_notice"]` from `["month"]` → `["name", "message"]` to match approved Meta template
- Recipients: `authorized_users` with role `admin/owner/receptionist` only — tenants never included

### PWA — Pre-register (`web/app/tenants/pre-register/page.tsx`)
- Security deposit field now auto-fills from monthly rent in real time (`depositOverridden` state)
- Clearing the field and tabbing away reverts to auto (rent value); typing a new value overrides
- "auto = 1 month rent" hint shown below the field (not in the label — prevents label wrapping on mobile)
- All inputs normalised to `h-[42px]` — fixes misaligned grid boxes on mobile (date input was shorter than number inputs)

### PWA — Bookings (`web/app/onboarding/bookings/page.tsx`)
- Ready-to-check-in cards now collapsed by default — shows name, room, check-in, rent only
- "▼ View details & collect" toggle expands agreed terms + collection form
- "Check In →" on collapsed card auto-expands; "Save & Check In" only appears when expanded
- Search input style matched to checkouts/notices pattern (`bg-bg`, `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-brand-pink/40`)
- Search filter by name or room across all sections (ready / awaiting / expired)
- "Total outstanding" value now bold dark ink, same weight as "Collecting now"

## [1.75.80] — 2026-05-15 — EBITDA matrix + financial analysis session

### Scripts
- `scripts/ebitda_matrix_jun2026.py` — EBITDA sensitivity matrix for Jun 2026 rent planning
  - Layout: Metric | Rent/bed | 80%–100% occupancy columns
  - 3 price points: ₹14,000 / ₹13,500 / ₹13,000 (descending)
  - 3 sections per scenario: EBITDA | After GST 12% | Net-Net (GST+IT 8%)
  - 2 scenarios: S1 current property rent ₹21,32,000 | S2 post-increase ₹22,14,000 (+₹82K)
  - OPEX: fixed (property rent) + variable (Apr'26 actual ₹9,93,067 at 270 beds, scaled by occupancy)

### Financial analysis (no code changes)
- Confirmed GST exemption: Cozeevo rates ₹433–₹467/day well below ₹1,000/day threshold → no GST liability
- Explained April actual EBITDA (₹9,33,085) vs matrix projection gap: higher occupancy (91% vs 85%) + maintenance fees ₹2.87L (lumpy, check-in month only) + property rent timing
- Maintenance fees confirmed as non-recurring (only on new check-ins, not steady-state)
- P&L vs balance sheet reconciliation: P&L = profitability this month; balance sheet = cumulative cash position since Oct'25
- Cash reconciliation: ₹13.14L gap between (adjusted profit + deposits) and actual holdings explained by owner loans still in bank + April rent not yet paid

## [1.75.79] — 2026-05-15 — Bookings check-in UX overhaul + dues calculation fixes

### Bookings page — check-in collection form (`web/app/onboarding/bookings/page.tsx`)
- Removed auto-payment creation for `obs.booking_amount` and `obs.security_deposit` — these are reference-only agreed amounts, not collected at check-in
- Reference tiles renamed to **Agreed Terms** section (1st Month Rent, Advance Paid, Deposit — display only)
- Input section renamed to **Collected at Check-in** (Rent + Deposit fields with CASH/UPI toggle)
- Advance (booking_amount) now deducted from deposit pre-fill, not rent: `deposit_prefill = security_deposit − booking_amount`
- Frozen **Total dues** line shows original calculated amount; **Total collecting** updates dynamically as fields are typed
- Pre-fill runs once on mount via `useRef` guard — user edits never overwritten by re-renders
- Pre-fill from booking data when no tenancy yet (before check-in); from live dues API when tenancy exists
- iOS scroll fix: `overflow-y-auto + WebkitOverflowScrolling: touch` on page container

### Dues modal (`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`)
- **Rent field** now shows rent-only portion: `total_dues − deposit_due` (was showing bundled total)
- **Deposit field** pre-fill corrected: uses `fullDues` with proper `booking_amount` deduction
- Input amounts updated when `fullDues` loads so fields match actual remaining

### Backend dues endpoint (`src/api/v2/tenants.py`)
- `deposit_due = max(0, security_deposit − booking_amount − deposit_paid)` — advance now correctly deducted from deposit outstanding

### Data ops (Pratham S Kore test resets)
- Cancelled tenancy 1102 (no_show → cancelled) to clear room 420 overlap during re-test
- Cancelled tenancy 1103 + voided payments 15968/15969 after final test; session reset to pending_review

## [1.75.78] — 2026-05-15 — Bookings check-in collection + notices fix + data ops

### Bookings: collected-at-check-in payments (`web/app/onboarding/bookings/page.tsx`, `src/api/onboarding_router.py`)
- New "Collected at check-in" section on each `pending_review` booking card
- Fields: 1st month rent (pro-rata pre-filled for mid-month check-ins), Security deposit, Advance paid, Against dues
- Cash / UPI toggle; "Due at check-in" summary shows outstanding before confirming
- Backend `ApproveRequest` extended: `collected_rent`, `collected_deposit`, `collected_advance`, `collected_dues`, `checkin_payment_mode`
- On approve, backend creates Payment rows immediately (`for_type`: rent / deposit / booking / rent); notes = "Collected at check-in"
- Day-stay bookings: maintenance field hidden; rent tile shows `₹900/day + Adv: ₹10,000` instead of blank
- Added `booking_amount`, `daily_rate`, `stay_type` to `Booking` interface in TypeScript

### Notices: `is_full_exit` date-aware fix (`src/api/v2/notices.py`)
- Bug: Room 621 showed "Full room / 2 of 2 leaving" in May filter even though Sajith leaves June 14 (only Ashit leaves May)
- Fix: pre-compute per-tenancy `expected_checkout` and `room_notice_checkouts`; `is_full_exit` now True only for the tenant with the **latest** checkout date in that room (`expected_checkout >= room_max_checkout`)
- Same fix applied to `kpi.py` notices query

### Sharing type in tenant detail card (`src/api/v2/tenants.py`, `web/lib/api.ts`, `web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`)
- `GET /tenants/{id}/dues` now returns `sharing_type`
- `TenantDues` TypeScript interface extended with `sharing_type: string | null`
- `TenantDetailCard` shows "Sharing type" row between Check-in and Agreed rent

### Onboarding link text fix (`src/api/onboarding_router.py`)
- WhatsApp message was saying "2 hours" — corrected to "48 hours" (link validity was already 48h in DB)

### Data ops
- Restored Pratham S Kore (Room 420, token `f0e7fc81`) from `cancelled` → `pending_review` (accidentally cancelled)
- Voided 6 ops-sheet-imported payments for Prithviraj Rai (Room 420): IDs 3017, 3018, 14243, 14244, 14789, 15505 (total ₹73,000)
  - Required `SET LOCAL app.allow_historical_write = 'true'` for historical rows
- **Policy established**: ops-sheet payments (`notes ILIKE '%source sheet%'`) are ALWAYS voided — saved to `memory/rules_data_sync.md` §10

---

## [1.75.77] — 2026-05-14 — Exit notices bulk load + notices UI overhaul

### Exit notices bulk loaded (`scripts/_load_exit_notices.py`)
- One-shot script bulk-set 46 exit notices with `notice_date = 2026-05-04`
- Key fix: column is `notice_date` not `notice_given` (was crashing with column-not-found)
- Dry run: 31 SET, 15 already set, 0 not found. All 31 committed with `--write`
- 4 tenants with variable stays use `relativedelta` for N-month checkout
- 3 past-date checkouts (Omkar 611, Prajwal 414, Jahnavi 214) set anyway — will update once Kiran confirms actual dates

### Notices page full redesign (`web/app/notices/page.tsx`)
- Summary bar: Beds freeing / Full rooms / Tenants — computed from filtered set
- Sort toggle (asc/desc by days remaining) + name/room search (compact) + month chips on one row
- Type chips: All / Full room / Premium / Male / Female
- `NoticeCard`: Full-room orange badge, Premium purple badge, M/F gender badge, "N beds" subtitle for premium, "Room occupancy: X of Y leaving" grid field
- `monthKey()` / `monthLabel()` helpers for derived month list

### Notices API extended (`src/api/v2/notices.py`)
- Second query: `room_active_counts` — all active monthly tenants per room (for full-room exit detection)
- `room_notice_counts` via `defaultdict`
- New response fields: `gender`, `sharing_type`, `beds_freed`, `room_max_occupancy`, `room_active_count`, `room_notice_count`, `is_full_exit`
- `beds_freed = room.max_occupancy if is_premium else 1`
- `is_full_exit = room_notice_count >= room_active_count > 0`

### KPI notices tile enhanced (`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`, `src/api/v2/kpi.py`)
- Same month / type / gender filters + sort as /notices page
- Inline detail expand: clicking a notice row shows `TenantDetailCard` inline (no scroll-to-bottom); uses `React.Fragment` pattern
- Bottom detail card suppressed when notices tile is open
- `kpi.py` notices query extended with `Tenant.gender`, `Tenancy.sharing_type`, `Room.max_occupancy`, `Room.id` — same room_active/notice logic

### TypeScript types (`web/lib/api.ts`)
- `NoticeItem` extended: `gender`, `sharing_type`, `beds_freed`, `room_max_occupancy`, `room_active_count`, `room_notice_count`, `is_full_exit`
- `KpiDetailItem` extended with optional notice fields: `expected_checkout_iso`, `days_remaining`, `beds_freed`, `sharing_type`, `is_full_exit`, `room_active_count`, `room_notice_count`

## [1.75.76] — 2026-05-14 — Cash/UPI accuracy + bookings UX fixes

### Cash/UPI totals now match sheet Z/AA
- `src/services/reporting.py`: HOW IT WAS PAID breakdown = rent-only (excludes deposits backfilled from Excel, excludes booking advances which have their own sheet column)
- `src/api/v2/finance.py`: Cash tab collected = rent-only; booking advances (LELIN DAS ₹27K + Samruddhi ₹52K) were inflating by ₹79K; 6-month history loop fixed too
- `scripts/_import_may_payments.py --write`: added 6 missing May rent payments; final gap vs sheet < ₹10K (bot-logged payments not in sheet)

### Cash expenses backfilled from verified P&L (Nov 2025–Apr 2026)
- `scripts/_backfill_cash_expenses.py`: 11 CashExpense entries — property rent cash (Feb ₹15.32L, Mar ₹12.90L, Apr ₹14.49L), Kiran cash ops (Nov–Jan), Chandra cash ops (Mar–Apr), Manoj water cash (Jan+Apr)
- Cash tab month history now shows real outflows instead of ₹0 expenses

### PWA Bookings
- `pending_review` cards: inline Edit/Cancel replaces broken "Review & Edit →" link (was opening old PIN-gated admin page)
- Prorated first month rent shown in pink when check-in ≠ 1st: `INT(rent × days_remaining / days_in_month)`

### Staff quick-book access
- `src/api/v2/bookings.py`: staff role can now quick-book (was admin-only; Lokesh was blocked)

### Manage Tenants
- Removed "Onboarding Sessions" tile (was 404; route unused)

---

## [1.75.72] — 2026-05-14 — Auth, onboarding redirect, cash dedup, finance page cleanup

### Lokesh PWA access confirmed
- Auth account `Sai1522kl@gmail.com` exists with `role=staff`, email confirmed 2026-05-10
- Middleware already blocks `/finance` for non-admin; all other pages accessible — no code change needed

### Onboarding WhatsApp notification → PWA (`src/api/onboarding_router.py`)
- When tenant submits form, WhatsApp to receptionist now links to `app.getkozzy.com/onboarding/bookings`
- Was pointing to `api.getkozzy.com/admin/onboarding` — old PIN-gated HTML page that confused Lokesh
- Added `PWA_URL=https://app.getkozzy.com` to `.env`

### Old admin/onboarding HTML page removed (`src/api/onboarding_router.py`)
- `GET /admin/onboarding` (334-line PIN HTML page) replaced with 302 redirect to PWA bookings
- Component files for P&L/Cash/UPI untouched — can be re-enabled by restoring imports

### May cash dedup fix (DB)
- `_import_may_payments.py` was run twice; created 134 duplicate cash rent records dated 2026-05-01
- 134 payment IDs voided; May cash total corrected: ₹42,76,400 → ₹21,26,700 (131 tenancies, ₹21,49,700 excess)

### Finance page: only Occ. tab (`web/app/finance/page.tsx`)
- P&L, Cash, UPI tabs hidden; Finance page now opens directly to Occupancy tab
- Component files untouched — tabs can be re-enabled by restoring imports

---

## [1.75.71] — 2026-05-14 — Pre-register future tenant

### Backend (`src/api/v2/bookings.py`)
- `POST /bookings/quick-book` skips capacity check when `room_number == "000"` — allows parking unlimited future tenants in the placeholder room until room is assigned on check-in day

### PWA — new page (`web/app/tenants/pre-register/page.tsx`)
- Form: name, phone, expected move-in date, optional monthly rent
- Submits via `quickBook()` to room 000; sends WhatsApp onboarding link
- Success screen shows confirmation + link to Bookings; manual-share link shown if WhatsApp failed

### Home page (`web/app/page.tsx`)
- "Pre-register tenant / Future joiner — no room yet" link row added below the 3 quick-link buttons

---

## [1.75.70] — 2026-05-14 — May 2026 payments cleaned + inline Collect button

### May payment audit + cleanup
- Audited all May 2026 `payment_for_type=rent` payments — found 295 entries from multiple overlapping import runs (ops-sheet sync + Excel import + audit scripts)
- Voided all 295 May rent payments in bulk
- Re-imported 287 clean payments from single source (ops sheet cols Z/AA via `_import_may_payments.py`); totals match sheet exactly

### Inline Collect button (`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`)
- `QuickCollectModal` bottom sheet added — opens inline from dues panel list; pre-fills outstanding dues amount; method selector (Cash/UPI/Bank/Cheque); calls `createPayment()` directly
- Dues rows: replaced `<Link href="/payment/new?...">` with `<button onClick={() => onCollect(item)}>` — no page redirect
- `onCollect` prop threaded through `ExpansionPanel` → `PanelProps`; `collectingItem` state + modal render at KpiGrid level

---

## [1.75.68] — 2026-05-14 — Occupancy chart: rolling window filter + PDF fixes

### Occupancy tab rolling window (`src/api/v2/analytics.py`, `web/components/finance/occupancy-tab.tsx`, `web/lib/api.ts`)
- `GET /analytics/occupancy?months=N` — new query param (default 12); rolling window from today back N months, capped at START_MONTH Nov '25
- Future months auto-appear in chart as DB fills — no code changes ever needed
- Frontend: **6M / 12M / All** toggle (pink accent); refetches on change; default 12M

### PDF download fixes (`web/components/finance/occupancy-tab.tsx`)
- Transparent Chart.js canvas flattened onto `#080d14` before capture → PDF now matches live dark theme
- Downscale to CSS pixel resolution before capture; PDF page size = CSS dimensions (1pt per px) → fonts identical to live view
- Download button: white text + frosted-glass pill (`bg-white/10`) → clearly visible in fullscreen
- All chart fonts (legend, axis labels, ticks) now dynamic via `fontSizePlugin` (10–20px scaling with chart width) → PDF labels readable at all sizes

---

## [1.75.67] — 2026-05-14 — Occupancy chart: fullscreen table, dynamic fonts, mobile portrait fix, nearTop flip, PDF download

### Occupancy tab polish (`web/components/finance/occupancy-tab.tsx`)
- **Table fullscreen** — Monthly Breakdown table gets its own expand button; `expanded` state extended to `null | 1 | 2 | 3` (3 = table)
- **Dynamic font scaling** — `dynFs(chart, min=7, max=22)` rescaled: divisor 55→65, max cap 9→22; mobile ~7px, desktop ~9px, fullscreen ~22px
- **Mobile portrait fullscreen** — chart height changed from `flex-1` (caused ~800px on portrait) to `min(calc(100vh - 120px), 80vmin)`; `80vmin` caps height on portrait mobile
- **nearTop label flip** — high-occupancy months (e.g. 98%) had labels overlapping the chart top; added `nearTop` detection: when label would render above `chartTop + fs*1.5`, flip to draw below the line point instead
- **PDF download in fullscreen** — download button appears only in fullscreen; charts 1+2 use canvas `toDataURL` → jsPDF landscape; table uses `html2canvas` (scale=2) → jsPDF landscape
- **Dependencies** — `jspdf` + `html2canvas` added to `web/package.json`

---

## [1.75.66] — 2026-05-14 — Room type corrections: G16+G19 single, G19 DB fix; TOTAL_BEDS 293

### DB
- `UPDATE rooms SET max_occupancy=1 WHERE room_number='G19'` — was 2, confirmed single sharing

### TOTAL_BEDS 294 → 293 (HULK 147→146)
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py`, `scripts/clean_and_load.py`
- `scripts/gsheet_apps_script.js`, `scripts/gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js`, `scripts/pg_charts.py`

### Docs
- `docs/MASTER_DATA.md` — HULK G floor layout corrected (G15=2, G16=1, G17-G18=2, G19=1, G20=1); revenue table updated; formula updated
- `docs/BRAIN.md`, `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md`, `docs/REPORTING.md`, `docs/SHEET_LOGIC.md` — all synced to 293

---

## [1.75.65] — 2026-05-14 — Staff rooms filter in vacant beds panel (count fix)

### web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx
- Staff room beds excluded from "X beds free" counter — staff rooms shown via toggle but not counted in revenue vacancy
- Fix: `if (it.is_staff_room) return s` in beds reducer

---

## [1.75.62] — 2026-05-14 — Room 614 → staff; TOTAL_BEDS 296→294; staff rooms filter

### DB
- `UPDATE rooms SET is_staff_room=TRUE WHERE room_number='614'` — 2 beds removed from revenue

### TOTAL_BEDS 296 → 294 (staff rooms: 6→7, THOR 5 + HULK 2)
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py`, `scripts/clean_and_load.py`
- `scripts/gsheet_apps_script.js`, `scripts/gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js`, `scripts/pg_charts.py`

### PWA — vacant beds Staff toggle
- `GET /kpi-detail?type=vacant&include_staff=true` — new query param; includes staff rooms when true; returns `is_staff_room` per item
- Vacant filter bar: "Staff" toggle button (indigo, default off); staff rows show indigo "Staff" badge
- Separate `"vacant_staff"` cache key; toggling doesn't pollute the regular vacant cache
- `web/lib/api.ts` — `getKpiDetail(type, opts?, token?)` signature updated; `KpiDetailItem.is_staff_room` added

### Docs
- `docs/MASTER_DATA.md`, `docs/BRAIN.md`, `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md`, `docs/REPORTING.md`, `docs/SHEET_LOGIC.md` — all synced; HULK floor 6 layout shows 614=staff

---

## [1.75.64] — 2026-05-14 — Occupancy chart: bright fonts, fullscreen nav fix, tooltip total, smaller labels

### Occupancy chart polish (`web/components/finance/occupancy-tab.tsx`)
- Legend/tick colors brightened: `#8899aa` → `#c8dae8`/`#b8ccdc` (was near-invisible on dark bg)
- Section titles: `text-ink-muted` (#6F655D) → `#9ab8cc` (was completely invisible on dark bg)
- Fullscreen z-index: `z-50` → `z-[60]` so chart covers nav bar in fullscreen mode
- Tooltip footer: shows `Total: N` (sum of all check-in types) when hovering Chart 1
- `dynFs`: max capped at 9 (was 14→11), divisor 40→55 — smaller labels on all screen sizes
- Bar labels clamped to `chartArea.top` — labels no longer clip/overflow at chart top edge
- Offset multipliers reduced (2.8→2.2, 1.2→0.8) — tighter spacing around line points

## [1.75.63] — 2026-05-14 — Notice/deposit logic corrected across all surfaces; sharing_type + G16 room changes; occupancy chart dynamic fonts; bookings edit/cancel; checkout comments; prebook defaults

### Room & sharing type changes (DB already applied)
- Rooms 304, 614, 511, 519, 618: `sharing_type` changed to `premium` in DB
- Room G16: `room_type` changed to `single` (max_occupancy 2→1) in DB
- TOTAL_BEDS 297→296 (G16 lost 1 bed, HULK 150→149)

### TOTAL_BEDS 297 → 296 updated in code
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py`, `scripts/clean_and_load.py`, `scripts/pg_charts.py`
- `scripts/gsheet_apps_script.js`, `scripts/gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js`
- `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md`, `docs/MASTER_DATA.md`, `docs/REPORTING.md`, `docs/SHEET_LOGIC.md`

### Notice / deposit forfeiture — corrected rule (deposit forfeited ONLY with zero notice)
- **Business rule (final):** Notice on/before 5th → same month exit, deposit refundable. Notice after 5th → next month's cycle, full month rent required, deposit still refundable. No notice at all → deposit forfeited.
- `src/api/v2/kpi.py` — `deposit_eligible = True if r.notice_date else None` (was `notice_date.day <= 5`)
- `web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx` — `depositForfeited = !prefetch.notice_date` only; notice banner now 3-state (no notice / late notice amber / on-time green)
- `web/app/notices/page.tsx` — legend updated with correct 2-point rule
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/tenant_handler.py` — late notice message now says next month's cycle, full month rent required, deposit still refundable (was wrongly saying forfeited)
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py` — checkout notice_line: late notice says "next month's cycle applies, deposit refundable"; forfeited only when no notice
- `web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx` — `depositEligible = noticeDate ? true : null`; helper text updated
- `src/services/pdf_generator.py` — house rule #1 updated with 2-point policy
- `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md`, `docs/REPORTING.md` — notice table corrected

### Occupancy chart dynamic fonts
- `web/components/finance/occupancy-tab.tsx` — `dynFs()` helper: font scales with `chart.width / 32` (min 9px, max 14px); label offsets relative to font size; no longer fixed 22px

### Bookings page — edit + cancel
- `web/app/onboarding/bookings/page.tsx` — `BookingCard` rewritten with 7-field inline edit panel (name, phone, room, checkin, rent, maintenance, deposit); save calls `PATCH /api/onboarding/admin/{token}`; cancel is 2-tap; both reload list
- `src/api/onboarding_router.py` — `PATCH /admin/{token}` endpoint added; `GET /admin/pending` now returns `maintenance_fee` + `security_deposit`
- `web/lib/api.ts` — `updateBookingSession()` + `cancelBookingSession()` added

### Prebook modal defaults
- `web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx` — maintenance defaults to ₹5,000 (editable); deposit auto-fills from rent; quickBook passes both fields
- `src/api/v2/bookings.py` — `QuickBookRequest` accepts `maintenance_fee` + `security_deposit`; `deposit = security_deposit if > 0 else monthly_rent`

### Vacant beds "Until X" badge fix
- Badge now shows 1 day before booking date (e.g. booking Jun 1 → "Until 31 May")

### Checkout comments field
- `web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx` — Comments textarea added
- `src/api/v2/checkout.py` — `CheckoutCreateBody.comments` field; maps to `other_comments`

### Commits
- `4664818` — notice logic fixes across all surfaces (this session final commit)

---

## [1.75.62] — 2026-05-14 — Room 614 → staff room; TOTAL_BEDS 296→294

### DB
- `UPDATE rooms SET is_staff_room=TRUE WHERE room_number='614'` — 2 beds removed from revenue

### TOTAL_BEDS 296 → 294 (staff rooms: 6 → 7, THOR 5 + HULK 2)
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py:175`
- `scripts/clean_and_load.py:23`
- `scripts/gsheet_apps_script.js:25`
- `scripts/gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js:19`
- `scripts/pg_charts.py:23`

### Docs updated
- `docs/MASTER_DATA.md` — staff table (+614), floor 6 layout, revenue table, formula, changelog
- `docs/BRAIN.md` — staff table (+614), revenue summary, formula
- `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` — HULK beds 149→147, total 296→294, TOTAL_BEDS note
- `docs/REPORTING.md` — HULK beds 149→147, total 296→294, staff rooms list
- `docs/SHEET_LOGIC.md` — TOTAL_BEDS 296→294

## [1.75.61] — 2026-05-14 — Occupancy tab: analytics API + PWA charts + Jitendra cash expenses

### src/api/v2/analytics.py
- **New `/analytics/occupancy` endpoint** — monthly occupancy dashboard: KPIs (today occ %, beds, avg rent, total check-ins/outs) + per-month breakdown (occ beds, fill %, check-ins by type, checkouts, avg rent/bed)
- **`START_MONTH = date(2025, 11, 1)`** — Oct 2025 had zero tenants; excluded from chart
- **`VERIFIED_MONTHS` dict** — frozen historical figures for Nov 2025–Apr 2026; never recomputed from live DB
- **Weighted avg rent** — `SUM(agreed_rent) / SUM(beds_used)` everywhere; premium rooms count max_occupancy beds; removed old `func.avg()` and per-checkin-month avg_map query
- **`_present_at(target)`** — includes active + exited-with-checkout-after-target + no_show-before-target

### web/components/finance/occupancy-tab.tsx
- **New `OccupancyTab` component** — 4 KPI cards, filter toggle (Monthly / All incl. Daily), 2 Chart.js charts, data table
- **Chart 1**: stacked bar (Single/Double/Triple/Premium/Daily check-ins) + white occupancy % line
- **Chart 2**: check-ins vs check-outs bars + yellow avg rent/bed line
- **Fullscreen per chart** — expand/collapse button; CSS `fixed inset-0 z-50` overlay (no requestFullscreen — iOS Safari doesn't support it); charts auto-resize via 60ms setTimeout
- **Data labels** — custom inline Chart.js plugins (`afterDatasetsDraw`) draw % labels on occ line and ₹k labels on rent line; no extra npm package
- **Axis titles** — "Check-ins", "Occ %", "Count", "Avg Rent" on all axes
- **Bug fix**: `text-ink` (Tailwind `ink.DEFAULT = #0F0E0D`) was invisible on dark bg; Total Check-ins KPI changed to `text-white`
- **Avg rent axis**: `stepSize: 2500`, `max: 22500`; callback shows `₹12.5k` etc. for half-k ticks

### web/app/finance/page.tsx
- Added "Occ." tab; renders `<OccupancyTab />`

### web/lib/api.ts
- Added `OccupancyMonthData`, `OccupancyKpi`, `OccupancyData` interfaces and `getOccupancyData()` function

### DB — cash_expenses (manual)
- Inserted 3 Jitendra cash expenses for Jan 2026: Police Pameshwaran cafe ₹3,000 + BBMP fee ₹5,000 + Agreement fee ₹600 (total ₹8,600); created_by='kiran-manual-jan26'

### Commits
- `23fdeed` — weighted avg rent + VERIFIED_MONTHS freeze
- `fc40abe` — blank KPI fix + fullscreen + axis labels + data labels

---

## [1.75.60] — 2026-05-13 — Onboarding form fixes: QR access + photo + security deposit + notes

### main.py
- **`/qr` added to `LocalOnlyMiddleware` allowlist** — was returning 403 to external requests. QR endpoint must be public.

### static/onboarding.html
- **Photo upload always shown** — `selfie-upload-area` was inside `room-summary-card` which only renders when session has pre-filled room/rent. QR-initiated sessions have neither, so photo was hidden. Moved photo card outside — now always shown regardless of session type.

### web/app/onboarding/new/page.tsx
- **Security deposit added to daily stay** — was only in monthly financials section; daily guests can also have a deposit.
- **Notes field added** — `special_terms` was wired in the API payload but had no input in the PWA. Added textarea below financials, visible for both monthly and daily.

### Commits
- `fda621c` — /qr middleware fix
- `508660f` — photo card fix
- `e3172ba` — security deposit + notes

---

## [1.75.59] — 2026-05-13 — P&L: reclassify OE transactions + merge CAPEX into Furniture & Supplies OPEX

### src/rules/pnl_classify.py
- **Abolished "Operational Expenses" catch-all** — all 71 rows from `reclassify_review.xlsx` now land in specific categories

- **New OPEX "Furniture & Supplies"**: `[0, 207021, 286755, 212229, 1187771, 13998, 148679]` (old F&F + Cap.Inv. + newly classified items)
- **Updated OPEX figures**: IT & Software (mobile bills added), Food & Groceries (WholesaleMandi/Amazon grocery), Fuel & Diesel (Shell/bus ticket), Staff & Labour (volipi.l + petty wages + medical), Cleaning Supplies (Hinglaj), Shopping & Supplies (new vendors), Marketing (Naukri QR)
- **Label changed**: "EBITDA / OPERATING PROFIT" → "NET OPERATING PROFIT (True Revenue − All Opex incl. Furniture & Supplies)"
- **ADJUSTED NET PROFIT** now: Operating Profit − Borrowed Money (CAPEX no longer a separate subtraction)
- **Deployed to VPS** (commit 6d640c0); 52 unit tests pass

### memory/reference_pnl_classifications.md
- CAPEX section updated to "ABOLISHED 2026-05-13 — merged into Furniture & Supplies OPEX"
- "Operational Expenses" OPEX entry replaced with "Furniture & Supplies" and "~~Operational Expenses~~ (ABOLISHED)"

---

## [1.75.58] — 2026-05-13 — P&L: borrowed money total + adjusted net profit + classification memory

### src/reports/pnl_builder.py
- **Borrowed Money total row** — added bold red total row at end of CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS section; sums all owner loan/advance columns across all months

- Delvin Raj: phone fixed to 7510688159; APR cash ₹11,500 + APR UPI ₹13,500 + MAY UPI ₹13,500 added to correct tenancy
- is_void=NULL bug: 3 raw-SQL inserts (ids 15367/15368/15369) had NULL is_void; fixed with UPDATE SET is_void=false

### memory/reference_pnl_classifications.md (rewrite + extension)

- Committed and pushed

---

## [1.75.57] — 2026-05-13 — QR walk-in onboarding + bookings page + phone dedup

### QR walk-in flow (main.py)
- **`GET /qr`** — static QR endpoint; IP rate-limited (3 scans/hr/IP); creates 2-hour `OnboardingSession` with `status=pending_tenant`; redirects to `/onboard/{token}`. One QR covers both buildings — room number on form determines building.
- `RedirectResponse`, `_rate_check` added to `main.py` imports.

### Onboarding redesign (src/api/onboarding_router.py)
- **Direct check-in removed** — `POST /direct-checkin` now returns HTTP 410; `DirectCheckinRequest` model deleted. All check-ins must flow through onboarding form.
- **`instant_checkin: bool = False`** added to `ApproveRequest` — when True, forces `status=active` regardless of future `checkin_date`. Used by the Bookings "Save & Check In" button.
- **Phone dedup at form submit** — `tenant_submit` now: (1) blocks 409 if phone already has active tenancy, (2) cancels any other `pending_tenant`/`pending_review` sessions for the same phone via raw SQL UPDATE, (3) stores normalised 10-digit phone on the session row.

### New PWA page: Bookings (web/app/onboarding/bookings/page.tsx)
- Loads `GET /api/onboarding/admin/pending`, filters to `status === "pending_review"` (form completed).
- Shows tenant name, phone, room, check-in date, rent, "Form filled" badge.
- "Review & Edit →" opens `admin/onboarding` in new tab.
- "Save & Check In" button → `POST /{token}/approve` with `instant_checkin: true` → marks tenancy `active` immediately.

### No-show: overdue indicator + cancel booking (src/api/v2/kpi.py, tenants.py)
- **KPI detail `no_show` items** — now include `is_overdue: bool` and `days_overdue: int` (when `checkin_date < today`).
- **`POST /tenancies/{id}/cancel-no-show`** — sets `status='cancelled'` (not `exited`), writes AuditLog entry; returns `{ok, tenancy_id, name}`.
- **PWA no_show panel** — red "Xd late" badge on overdue items; red "Cancel →" button only on overdue rows.

### Vacant beds "Until X" label (web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx)
- Vacant panel badge changed from "Booked DD Mon" → "Until DD Mon" for rooms with a future no-show booking.

### web/lib/api.ts
- `KpiDetailItem`: added `is_overdue?: boolean`, `days_overdue?: number`
- Added `cancelNoShow(tenancyId: number)` → `POST /api/v2/app/tenancies/{id}/cancel-no-show`

### web/app/page.tsx
- Added "Bookings" quick-link tile (alongside Checkouts, Notices, Sessions).

### web/app/onboarding/new/page.tsx
- Removed direct check-in branch (was: name field → immediately active tenancy). Form now always creates an onboarding session and sends WhatsApp link.

### Commits shipped
- `16ffd79` — vacant "Until X" + no-show overdue + cancel booking
- `2eb30f4` — QR walk-in + bookings page + remove direct check-in
- `4844480` — QR rate limit + phone dedup at form submission

## [1.75.54] — 2026-05-13 — Scheduler: rent reminders disabled + prep reminder delivery fix

### src/scheduler.py
- **Rent reminder auto-jobs DISABLED** — all 4 jobs (advance, day1, day3, day5) commented out per Kiran instruction 2026-05-13. Tenant rent reminders must now be sent manually via PWA. Do NOT re-enable without explicit instruction.
- **Prep reminder delivery fixed** — `_prep_reminder` was using `send_template("general_notice", ...)` which is a tenant-facing Meta approved template; admins were not receiving the 9am/2pm check-in/checkout briefings. Switched to `_send_whatsapp()` direct message — Kiran, Lakshmi, Prabhakaran will now receive these.
- **Lokesh excluded from prep reminders** — recipient query already changed to `role IN ('admin', 'owner')` (deployed earlier); do not add receptionist role back without explicit approval.
- Job count updated in startup log: 9 → 5.
- Deployed: commit 7883a51 → VPS active.

## [1.75.53] — 2026-05-13 — April/May payment sync + DB/sheet reconciliation complete

### April + May 2026 — DB now matches source sheet exactly
- **`scripts/_audit_apr_may_payments.py`** — new script; Phase 1 reads sheet+DB, Phase 2 writes with `SET LOCAL allow_historical_write`. Ran `--write`: **30 payments added** (all sheet > DB gaps for April + May).
- **`scripts/_fix_db_to_match_sheet.py`** — new script; fixed aggregation bug (shared-phone tenants were merging data across different people). Final run `--write`: **25 voided + 7 added** (Dhruv APR ₹6.5K + MAY ₹13K; Priyansh MAY ₹16K; 22 excess voids for tenants where DB had doubled May amounts).
- **3 phones SKIPped** (shared phone, can't safely attribute — need manual review): V.Sathya Priya/V.Bhanu Prakash (+918106778788), Prateek/Sanskar (+919971427645), Siddharth/Delvin (+917666862904).

### 4 no-show tenants added to DB
- Ayush Kolte (+918888012597) — HULK floor 5, rent ₹13K, checkin 2026-05-01, ₹2K APR UPI booking
- Diksha (+918295625664) — HULK floor 5, rent ₹13K, checkin 2026-05-01, ₹2K APR UPI booking
- Diksha Bhartia (+919331987138) — HULK, rent ₹14K, checkin 2026-05-30, ₹2K MAY UPI booking
- Devansh (+916290638842) — HULK floor 4 single, rent ₹23K, checkin 2026-05-30, ₹5K MAY UPI booking
- Synced to TENANTS sheet tab via `resync_missing_tenants_to_sheet.py --write`
- Skipped: Aditya Sable (Cancelled), Vijay Kumar (room="June" = data error)

### pnl_builder.py — cash holdings + label update
- `CASH_IN_HAND` updated: Lakshmi Apr closing ₹8,20,883; Prabhakaran ₹5,24,400
- Section header renamed: "CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS" → "BORROWED MONEY — Owner loans & advances (to be repaid, not P&L)"

## [1.75.52] — 2026-05-13 — Bank-only P&L tab + OPEX analysis + forecast model

### pnl_builder.py — refactored to shared writer + new tabs
- **Refactor:** extracted `_write_pnl_tab(ws, income_dict, opex_dict)` — single shared renderer
- **Tab 1:** "P&L — Full (incl Cash)" — canonical report (all items, renamed from "P&L Summary")
- **Tab 2:** "Bank — Digital Only" — same layout but removes:
  - `Cash (physical — both buildings combined)` from income
  - `Property Rent — Cash paid` from OPEX
  - Result: bank-only EBITDA slightly higher (~₹10.0L Apr) than full EBITDA (₹9.4L Apr) because cash collected (₹13.9L) < cash rent paid (₹14.5L) — cash economy is a ₹0.6L/month drag
- **Tab 3:** "Rules Applied" updated — rent formula corrected to ₹13,000×164=₹21.32L (Jan–Jun) / ₹13,500×164=₹22.14L (Jul+); forecast benchmarks added
- **Excel regenerated** → `data/reports/PnL_Accrual_2026_05_13.xlsx`

### OPEX analysis + forecast model (this session)
- **Rent corrected:** ₹20.5L → ₹21.32L/month (₹13,000 × 164 beds, Jan–Jun 2026); ₹22.14L from Jul
- **OPEX actual:** Mar ₹29.3L, Apr ₹30.3L — previous ₹28.2L estimate was understated
- **OPEX split:** Rent ₹21.32L fixed + Non-rent ~₹9L at 270 beds (91% occ)
- **Variable model (corrected):**
  - Fixed: Rent ₹21.32L + fixed ops (staff/waste/police/maintenance) ₹2.7L = ₹24.0L total fixed
  - Variable: ~₹2,593/bed (food, electricity, water, fuel, cleaning ~₹7L at 270 beds)
  - Break-even: ~66% (211 beds)
- **Forecast (91% current):** EBITDA ₹9.4L/month = ₹1.12Cr/year
- **July rent hike impact:** +₹82K/month fixed cost = −₹9.84L/year EBITDA

## [1.75.51] — 2026-05-12 — Security deposit / maintenance fee split fix

### pnl_builder.py — critical deduction fix
- **Bug:** DEPOSITS "Security Deposits" array (₹33,83,875) included maintenance fees (₹10,68,700)
  — we were wrongly deducting non-refundable maintenance from True Rent Revenue
- **Fix:** Split into pure refundable security = ₹23,15,175 (deducted) + maintenance ₹10,68,700 (kept in revenue)
- **Impact on True Rent Revenue:** +₹10,68,700 higher (maintenance no longer wrongly removed)
- **Impact on Cash Position liability:** ₹33,83,875 → ₹23,15,175 (we owe back less)
- **True free cash:** −₹11,95,071 → **−₹1,26,371** (bank nearly covers deposit obligations)
- **Excel regenerated** → `data/reports/PnL_Accrual_2026_05_12.xlsx`

### Memory / SOP updated
- `sop_pnl.md` — Step 1 True Revenue rule, Step 5 Deposits Held, Step 7 Cash Position all corrected
- `project_pending_tasks.md` — P&L open items updated

## [1.75.50] — 2026-05-12 — Kiran Capital Contributions finalised + P&L regenerated

### pnl_builder.py — Kiran advance row finalised: ₹1,23,217 total
- **Final values:** `[0, 39001, 51517, 32045, 654, 0, 0]`
  - Nov ₹39,001 — PhonePe vendors + Mr V AKIL ₹10,669 (Other Expense, confirmed PG)
  - Dec ₹51,517 — PhonePe + cash: fire ext/curtains/gas/stickers/cooker lock + garbage fine ₹6K + marketing ₹15K (2×₹7,500 payments)
  - Jan ₹32,045 — PhonePe first-aid/BBMP/ninjacart + wifi/gas cylinders/plants porter + RADHAKRISHNAN E ₹700 (Other Expense)
  - Feb ₹654 — Zepto PhonePe
- **Unisol CCTV ₹1,00,000** — tracked in CAPEX only; NOT duplicated in Kiran advance
- **9444448314 (Dec ₹5K + Apr ₹5K)** — confirmed personal, ignored
- **Marketing OPEX Dec:** ₹66,273 → ₹81,273 (+₹15,000 Kiran personal marketing payments)
- **Other Expenses:** Nov +₹10,669 (Mr V AKIL), Jan +₹700 (RADHAKRISHNAN E)
- **Removed unused imports** — `Optional` + `get_column_letter`
- **Excel regenerated** → `data/reports/PnL_Accrual_2026_05_12.xlsx`
- **PWA Excel download** — `/finance/pnl/excel` auto-picks up (calls `build_pnl_bytes()` from pnl_builder.py)

## [1.75.49] — 2026-05-12 — P&L methodology corrections + capital contributions overhaul

### pnl_builder.py — verified figures updated
- **Chandra March collection reclassified** — ₹1,60,600 moved from Cash income to THOR NEFT (bank, not physical cash)
- **Property rent split into 2 lines** — Cash paid + Bank UPI/RTGS paid (confirmed by Kiran):
  - Feb: ₹15,32,000 cash + ₹6,00,000 RTGS = ₹21,32,000 ✓
  - Mar: ₹12,90,000 cash + ₹6,05,140 RTGS = ₹18,95,140 (was ₹21,32,000 accrual — changes net by ₹2.37L)
  - Apr: ₹14,49,100 cash + ₹6,00,000 RTGS = ₹20,49,100 ✓
- **Capital Contributions expanded** — now 3 people: Lakshmi ₹1.43L (existing) + Chandra ₹0.71L (Mar/Apr ops cash, TBD confirm) + Kiran ~₹1.1L (TBD monthly split)
- **Loan Repayment renamed → Cash Exchange Repayments** — moved to EXCLUDED (not OPEX). These are bank RTGS repayments for cash received and already spent (double-counting if in OPEX). Explanation added in EXCLUDED section.
- **Security deposit deduction restored** — "Less: Security Deposits" + "True Rent Revenue" rows back in income section; EBITDA now on True Revenue (was inadvertently removed last session)
- **Dec Electricity confirmed** — ₹74,768 BESCOM via partner UPI (was in Govt/Regulatory before)
- **P&L regenerated** → `data/reports/PnL_Accrual_2026_05_03.xlsx`

### Final P&L (with March rent at ₹18.95L)
| | True Revenue | OPEX | EBITDA | CAPEX | Net |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Oct–Apr total | ₹122.7L | ₹102.8L | ₹19.9L | ₹18.9L | **₹1.0L** |
- ⚠️ March rent PENDING Kiran review — if ₹21.32L (standard), net = **−₹1.35L**

### NOT YET deployed — pnl_builder.py local only
- All 4 surfaces (live Excel API, JSON API, PWA cards) still show old figures
- Deploy after Kiran confirms March rent figure

## [1.75.48] — 2026-05-12 — THOR outstanding analysis + UPI auto-reconciliation build

### THOR Outstanding May 2026 analysis
- **`scripts/_thor_outstanding.py`** — one-off: THOR-only outstanding analysis for May 2026; checks both THOR + HULK bank pools for each tenant (cross-building payments)
- Result: 24 tenants outstanding, Rs.2,25,434 total
- 8 cross-building payments found (THOR tenants paying into HULK account)
- Output: `data/reports/THOR_Outstanding_May2026.xlsx` (THOR Outstanding + THOR All Tenants sheets)
- Known issues: G.D.Abhishek (initials-only name, Rs.22K unmatched in bank) + Navdeep/Navdaap duplicate (rooms 000+506, same person)

### UPI auto-reconciliation system (full build)
- **`src/database/models.py`** — added `UpiCollectionEntry` model (rrn, account_name, txn_date, amount, payer_vpa, payer_phone, payer_name, tenancy_id, payment_id, matched_by, period_month; unique on rrn)
- **`src/database/migrate_all.py`** — added `run_upi_collection_table_2026_05_11()` migration (table created via Supabase MCP due to asyncpg statement_timeout)
- **`src/services/upi_reconciliation.py`** — core service: parse XLSX/CSV, 3-tier tenant matching (phone from VPA → exact name → fuzzy), create Payment records (unique_hash=rrn), create UpiCollectionEntry, idempotent (safe re-upload)
- **`src/api/v2/finance.py`** — 3 new endpoints: `POST /finance/upi-reconcile`, `POST /finance/upi-reconcile/assign`, `GET /finance/upi-reconcile/unmatched`
- **`src/workers/__init__.py`** — new module
- **`src/workers/gmail_poller.py`** — daily Gmail IMAP poller: fetch unseen emails with HULK/THOR subject keywords → download XLSX/CSV attachment → reconcile → WhatsApp alert for unmatched entries to ADMIN_WHATSAPP
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — added `UpiMatchedEntry`, `UpiUnmatchedEntry`, `UpiReconcileResult` types + `uploadUpiFile()`, `getUnmatchedUpi()`, `assignUpiEntry()` functions
- **`web/components/finance/upi-reconcile-tab.tsx`** — new PWA tab: month picker, HULK/THOR selector, file upload, result summary (matched/unmatched/skipped cards), matched list, unmatched queue with Refresh
- **`web/app/finance/page.tsx`** — added "UPI" tab (3rd tab alongside P&L + Cash)
- **`.env.example`** — added GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD, HULK_EMAIL_SUBJECT, THOR_EMAIL_SUBJECT, ADMIN_WHATSAPP
- **Not yet deployed** — needs VPS git pull + restart + Gmail setup (see pending tasks)

## [1.75.47] — 2026-05-12 — Other Expenses full reclassification + P&L reconcile

### Bank expense classification (76 rows reclassified)

## [1.75.46] — 2026-05-12 — Other expenses export + session close

### Analysis scripts (one-off, not deployed)
- **`scripts/_export_other_expenses.py`** — exports 77 unclassified bank expense rows + 6 Volipi rows to `data/reports/other_expenses_classify.xlsx` for Kiran to manually categorize. Groups by payee UPI ID with colour-coded amounts.
- **`scripts/_output_apr_may.txt`** — Apr/May tenant dues analysis output (329 tenants, HULK + THOR).
- **VPS deployed** — bank dedup fix (`8277e7d`) now live on production.

## [1.75.45] — 2026-05-12 — Bank dedup fix + P&L off-record expense integration

### Bank deduplication (permanent fix)
- **Root cause found:** 253 duplicate bank_transactions from `import_thor_to_db.py` — hash computed from raw CSV description, stored description differed (longer) → bypassed partial UNIQUE index
- **Migration `run_btxn_dedup_2026_05_12`:** deleted duplicates (kept min id), recomputed all hashes from stored descriptions, dropped partial index → full UNIQUE index on `unique_hash`, added composite `uq_btxn_content` index as backup guard
- **Upload API** (`POST /finance/upload`): replaced SELECT-before-INSERT with DB-atomic `pg_insert().on_conflict_do_nothing(index_elements=["unique_hash"]).returning(id)` — true idempotent uploads regardless of THOR vs HULK vs re-upload
- **rules_data_sync.md §9** — documented both UNIQUE indexes, ON CONFLICT pattern, root cause

### P&L off-record expense integration
- Read all 12 expense/income images + verified against Kiran's PhonePe statement (May'25–May'26)
- **pnl_builder.py updated** — 20+ line-item changes across Oct'25–Apr'26:
  - **CAPEX Dec:** +₹1,00,000 Unisol CCTV system (Kiran cash)
  - **Cash income Jan:** +₹25,000 Bala uncle; Feb: +₹3,000; Apr: +₹35,000
  - **Cash income Mar:** +₹600 (esob/lokimom cash exchanges); Apr: +₹12,000 (esob/lsob)

## [1.75.44] — 2026-05-11 — Outstanding dues analysis: April + May, THOR deep-check

### Analysis scripts (one-off, not deployed)
- **`scripts/_export_outstanding_v2.py`** — April + May outstanding using Google Sheet as source (cash + UPI); May cross-checked vs bank. Output: `data/reports/April_Outstanding_2026.xlsx` (33 tenants, Rs.1,97,400) + `data/reports/May_Outstanding_2026.xlsx` (70 tenants, Rs.7,57,045)
- **`scripts/_thor_outstanding.py`** — THOR-only May outstanding; checks THOR May bank + HULK May bank for cross-building payments. Output: `data/reports/THOR_Outstanding_May2026.xlsx` (24 tenants, Rs.2,25,434)
- **`scripts/_may_full_analysis.py`** — Full May analysis both buildings (76 tenants, Rs.8,36,336)

### Key findings
- 8 THOR tenants paying to HULK bank (cross-building): Ganesh Divekar 603, Nithin 202, Shirin 210, P.N.Charan 510, Shilpa 212, Didla Lochan G07, Suraj Prasana 106
- April HULK bank = batch settlements only — no per-tenant match possible; THOR April individual UPI available via `thor bank statement april til now.xlsx`
- G.D.Abhishek (612) — single-char initials break fuzzy match; HULK bank shows Rs.22K from "G D ABHISHEK" — not auto-matched, needs manual review
- Navdeep/Navdaap (rooms 000 + 506) — same person, same phone 9953195499, two tenancy records — double-counted in reports

## [1.75.43] — 2026-05-11 — May data load: payments, exit notices, new tenants

### Data operations

- **2 new tenants added** — Akshay Kothari (room 522, no_show, check-in Jun 1, rent ₹14K + ₹2K booking UPI); P.N.Charan (room 510, active May 5, rent ₹12.5K + ₹7K May payments)
- **Lakshmi Pathi (219) checkout_record created** — exit May 7, no refund (day-wise, zero deposit)
- **`scripts/_add_may_new_tenants.py`** — one-shot script for above
- **Ops sheet synced** — May 2026: Collected ₹42,66,970 | Cash ₹21,75,300 | UPI ₹20,91,670 | Dues ₹5,76,850 | 189 PAID / 70 PARTIAL | 13 notices | Occ 95.6%

### Inconsistencies flagged
- Vijay Kumar (phone +919600288048) — room col says "June" = data error; skip
- Akshay Kothari not previously in DB (now added as June no_show)
- P.N.Charan not previously in DB (now added as active May 5)
- Source sheet col AB used as freetext notes (exit dates, payment promises, balances) — not a structured column

## [1.75.42] — 2026-05-11 — Cash tracking: Cash tab on Finance page

### New feature — Cash tab
- **`cash_expenses` table** — manually logged cash outflows (date, description, amount, paid_by, soft-delete via is_void)
- **`cash_counts` table** — append-only physical cash count log (date, amount, counted_by, notes); used for spot-check variance
- **4 new API endpoints** on `GET /api/v2/app/finance/cash?month=`:
  - `GET /finance/cash` — monthly cash position: collected (auto from payments), expenses_total, balance, last_count + variance, expense list, 6-month history
  - `POST /finance/cash/expenses` — log cash expense (admin-only)
  - `DELETE /finance/cash/expenses/{id}` — void expense (soft-delete)
  - `POST /finance/cash/counts` — log physical count; variance = balance − counted
- **`web/components/finance/cash-tab.tsx`** — full Cash tab UI: month picker, dark balance card, 2 stat cards (collected green / expenses red), count check card with variance (short/over/matches), expense list with two-tap void, 6-month history table, Add Expense sheet, Log Count sheet
- **`web/app/finance/page.tsx`** — added Cash tab to tab bar (P&L | Cash); independent month state per tab
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — CashPosition types + getCashPosition/addCashExpense/voidCashExpense/logCashCount helpers
- **`tests/test_cash_logic.py`** — 5 unit tests for balance and variance calculation
- DB tables applied via Supabase MCP (migration script has pre-existing deadlock in earlier step)
- Not yet deployed to VPS

## [1.75.41] — 2026-05-10 — Deposit forfeiture fix: only on no-notice, not late notice

### Business logic fix — notices
- **Root cause:** `NOTICE_BY_DAY = 5` was incorrectly forfeiting deposits for anyone who gave notice after the 5th, even if they gave 30–45 days advance notice for a future month.
- **Correct rule:** notice after 5th → must stay till end of next month (last day unchanged). Deposit always refundable if notice was given. Only forfeited with zero notice.
- `services/property_logic.py` — `is_deposit_eligible()` now always returns True; docstring updated
- `src/api/v2/notices.py` — `deposit_eligible = True` for all tenants with a notice date
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py` — 4 forfeiture checks fixed; late-notice text now says "must stay till end of next month, deposit refundable"; extra_month penalty removed for late-notice settlement (they're already paying that rent)
- Deployed to VPS ✓

## [1.75.40] — 2026-05-10 — PWA page-switch lag eliminated

### Performance
- **Middleware:** switched `supabase.auth.getUser()` → `getSession()` — eliminates Supabase network round-trip (~150–300ms) on every page navigation; data APIs still verify JWT server-side
- **Loading skeletons:** added `web/app/loading.tsx` (home `/`) and `web/app/collection/breakdown/loading.tsx` — skeleton appears in same frame as tap while server fetches data; previously blank screen until all API calls completed
- Deployed to VPS ✓

## [1.75.39] — 2026-05-10 — P&L cash in hand confirmed + REPORTING formula fix

### pnl_builder.py
- Added `CASH_IN_HAND`: Lakshmi ₹10,63,500 + Prabhakaran ₹8,23,350 = ₹18,86,850 (Apr 30 confirmed)
- Cash Position: per-person breakdown + two free-cash lines
  - True free cash (bank − deposits): −₹11,32,571
  - True free cash incl. cash in hand: **+₹7,54,279**
- Deployed to VPS ✓

### Docs
- REPORTING.md + sop_pnl.md: cash position formula corrected (active-tenants-only, no double-deduction)

## [1.75.38] — 2026-05-10 — Personal session: SAC career framework (no project changes)

### No project code changed
- Created 3 personal career reference documents (saved to desktop, not in repo):
  - `SAC_Career_Roadmap.md` — career advice: Senior Consultant → Senior Manager
  - `SAC_Master_Framework.md` — 8-framework operating system (technical, delivery, docs, client, growth, promotion, communication)
  - `SAC_Model_Configuration_Guide.md` — complete SAC model config reference: dimension fields, hierarchy types, aggregation logic, irreversible actions

---

## [1.75.37] — 2026-05-10 — P&L audit: deposit fix, Lavanya 50%, orphan dedup, SBI spend report

### Fixes — pnl_builder.py
- **Deposit double-deduction removed** — Cash Position `_sec_collected` is active-tenants-only from DB; refunds to exited tenants already reflected in bank closing balance. Removed the `-Rs.4,61,845` deduction. Net deposits owed: ₹28,59,530 → ₹33,21,375. True free cash: −₹6,70,726 → −₹11,32,571.
- **Lavanya Ravishankar Nov F&F** — paid ₹49,600, she refunded 50% back. Net expense = ₹24,800. Updated DB id=2607 amount + pnl_builder Nov F&F: ₹1,49,821 → ₹1,25,021.

### DB cleanup — orphan duplicate deletions
- Deleted id=1273 (Naveen Kumar Apr 28, ₹21,060, upload_id=NULL) — duplicate of id=1013

### Naveen Kumar confirmed
- Naveen Kumar M ₹50,000 (gym, Nov 13) — in CAPEX Furniture & Fittings ✓
- Naveen Kumar B S ₹43,426 (architect, Dec 2) — Partner Capital (Whitefield), excluded from P&L ✓

### Analysis — All SBI spend (LAKSHMI_SBI + PERSONAL_SBI_0167), Oct 2025–Apr 2026
| Month | OPEX | CAPEX | Deposit Refunds | Partner Capital | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nov 2025 | ₹32,864 | ₹75,021 | — | ₹2,20,250 | ₹3,28,135 |
| Dec 2025 | ₹1,36,611 | ₹52,550 | — | ₹2,56,563 | ₹4,45,724 |
| Jan 2026 | ₹41,899 | — | — | — | ₹41,899 |
| Feb 2026 | ₹18,264 | — | — | — | ₹18,264 |
| Mar 2026 | ₹750 | — | ₹22,000 | — | ₹22,750 |
| Apr 2026 | ₹6,928 | — | ₹9,970 | — | ₹16,898 |
| **Total** | **₹2,37,316** | **₹1,27,571** | **₹31,970** | **₹4,76,813** | **₹8,73,670** |
- LAKSHMI_SBI (main) only has Nov–Dec 2025 data; Jan–Apr 2026 LAKSHMI_SBI bank statements not yet imported
- Griham Decor ₹49,200 (Dec 27) still in F&F — confirm if this belongs in Whitefield tracker

### VPS deployed ✓

## [1.75.36] — 2026-05-10 — Auth: login gate, roles, forgot password, logout

### Auth — 5 Supabase users created
- Created 5 auth accounts directly via SQL (pgcrypto bcrypt) — email confirmed, login-ready immediately
  - `Sai1522kl@gmail.com` → staff (Lokesh); `Cozeevo@gmail.com` → admin; `krish484@gmail.com` → admin (Kiran); `lakshmigorjala6@gmail.com` → admin (Lakshmi); `devarajuluprabhakaran1@gmail.com` → admin (Prabhakaran)
- `scripts/create_auth_users.py` — idempotent script for future use (needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`)

### Auth — middleware login gate + finance role gate
- `web/middleware.ts` — unauthenticated → `/login`; staff on `/finance/**` → `/`; 3s timeout fail-open; `/auth/**` always allowed

### Auth — forgot password + set password flow
- `web/app/auth/callback/route.ts` — PKCE code exchange → `/auth/update-password`
- `web/app/auth/update-password/page.tsx` — any logged-in user can set new password (no email flow required; navigate directly after login with temp password)
- `web/app/login/page.tsx` — "Forgot password?" button added; removed hardcoded email default

### Auth — logout
- Tap the pink avatar circle (top-right of home) → signs out → login screen

### Fix — delete tenant "Failed to fetch"
- `src/api/v2/tenants.py` — removed `"agreements"` from nullable FK cleanup loop; table does not exist in schema → was causing 500 UndefinedTableError → browser saw "Failed to fetch"

## [1.75.34] — 2026-05-10 — Import partner personal SBI (0167) expenses — PhonePe + Paytm

### Data — Partner personal account reimbursable expenses (Jan–Apr 2026)
- Sources: PhonePe_Transaction_Statement.pdf (59 debits) + Paytm XLSX (27 debits), SBI account XX0167
- 86 raw rows → 30 personal excluded → **56 business transactions inserted** into `bank_transactions` (account_name=PERSONAL_SBI_0167, upload_id=8)
- Reimbursement Excel: `data/reports/SBI_0167_Reimbursement.xlsx`

### Excluded (personal — confirmed by Kiran)
- Hospital (Motherhood, SPS) + pharmacy (Apollo) + baby stores (Born Babies, Zippycubs) = personal medical
- Restaurants (KFC, California Burrito, GoPizza, Coffee Day, HMS Host) = personal food
- Clothing (H&M, Myntra, Trends, Sharif Foot Wear) = personal shopping
- Parlour (Velidi Venkata Chaithanya), personal transfer to Kiran

### Reclassified (per Kiran instructions)
- HOUSE HUNT ₹17,700 → Marketing / Influencer Channel Marketing Fee
- Anumola Yoga Anil Kumar ₹11,000 + Aahil Rafiq ₹11,000 → Tenant Deposit Refund
- P Deepa ₹9,970 → Tenant Deposit Refund
- Notion Online Solutions ₹1,852×2 + ₹1,454 → IT & Software / Recruitment Software
- Shubh Chikan ₹3,000 → Food & Groceries (PG food)

### P&L impact (pnl_builder.py)
- New OPEX line "Partner Reimbursable (Personal Acct SBI 0167)": Jan ₹41,899 + Feb ₹18,264 + Mar ₹750 + Apr ₹6,928 = **₹67,841**
- Deposit refunds added to EXCLUDED Tenant Deposit Refund: Mar +₹22,000 → 160,231; Apr +₹9,970 → 139,638
- Total reimbursable from company: **₹99,811** (OPEX ₹67,841 + deposits ₹31,970)

## [1.75.35] — 2026-05-10 — P&L CAPEX reconciliation: remove partner capital, fix DB duplicates

### Investigation
- April electricity discrepancy: DB showed ₹2,81,318 vs pnl_builder ₹1,40,659
  - Root cause: duplicate BESCOM import (id=1452, upload_id=NULL orphan). Deleted.
  - pnl_builder ₹1,40,659 = correct (March bill paid April). April bill (₹1,96,367) appears in May.
- Cross-checked Investment.xlsx (29 LAKSHMI_SBI records) vs Whitefield PG Expense Tracker
  - 12 of 18 CAPEX items confirmed in Whitefield tracker = partner capital, not company P&L CAPEX
  - 2 uncertain items (Lavanya ₹49,600 architect, Naveen Kumar M ₹50,000 gym) confirmed NOT in tracker → kept
  - Lavanya paid from LAKSHMI_SBI (not THOR). Prabhakaran paid Naveen Kumar advance; Lakshmi paid balance.

### P&L correction — pnl_builder.py
- Nov Furniture & Fittings: ₹3,70,071 → ₹1,49,821 (−₹2,20,250 partner capital removed)
- Dec Furniture & Fittings: ₹4,19,304 → ₹1,62,741 (−₹2,56,563 partner capital removed)
- Dec Food & Groceries: ₹88,250 → ₹89,065 (+₹815 Zepto Dec 31 from LAKSHMI_SBI, inserted to DB)
- Total CAPEX: ₹22,63,081 → ₹17,86,268 (−₹4,76,813)

### DB cleanup — bank_transactions
- Reclassified 12 LAKSHMI_SBI records from "Furniture & Fittings" → "Partner Capital (Whitefield)"
  - ₹4,76,813 removed from CAPEX in live DB (PWA on-screen now matches pnl_builder)
- Deleted 4 orphan April CAPEX duplicate rows (id=1374, 1352, 1339, 1269, upload_id=NULL)
  - April F&F: ₹4,326 → ₹2,163 (matches pnl_builder)
- Deleted 2 orphan April duplicates (BESCOM id=1452, Virani id=1514) — from earlier session

### Partner Investment Report
- Generated `data/reports/Partner_Investment_Report.xlsx` — 2 sheets (Summary + 228 transaction rows)
- Whitefield tracker totals by investor: Lakshmi, Kiran, Prabhakaran, Ashokan, Jitendra, Narendra
- PWA Finance page investment section planned (owner-only, shows tracker data with full detail)

### DB verification
- All CAPEX months (Oct–Apr) in bank_transactions now match pnl_builder exactly ✓

## [1.75.32] — 2026-05-09 — Import Lakshmi SBI investment spend into P&L

### Data — Investment.xlsx (Lakshmi SBI direct vendor payments, Oct–Dec 2025)
- 32 transactions inserted into `bank_transactions` (account_name=LAKSHMI_SBI, upload_id=7)
- Direct SBI→vendor payments never captured in THOR/HULK Yes Bank CSV
- Skipped: Oct capital transfers to Cozeevo (already in Capital Contributions), test txns, Chandra credits

### CAPEX added
- Nov +₹3,20,071 (Griham Decor, Naveen Kumar gym, Lavanya, Kumar UC, carpets, nursery)
- Dec +₹3,09,113 (architect ₹43K, Griham Decor ₹2.28L, Decor Studio plants, fire extinguishers, wardrobe)
- Total CAPEX: ₹16,33,897 → ₹22,63,081 (+₹6.29L)

### OPEX added
- Food & Groceries: Nov +₹32,546, Dec +₹53,815
- Other Expenses: Dec +₹72,781 (Chandra PG ₹70K + misc)
- Marketing: Dec +₹9,000 | Fuel: Dec +₹200

### P&L impact
- EBITDA: ₹18,25,678 → ₹16,57,018 (15.2% → 13.8%)
- Net Profit: +₹1,91,781 → −₹6,06,063 (₹7.97L hidden spend now visible)

### Classifier additions (`src/rules/pnl_classify.py`)
- Griham Decor, Naveen Kumar, Lavanya Ravishankar, Decor Studio, Kaizen, carpets, nursery, architect → Furniture & Fittings
- Signs & Signages → Marketing

## [1.75.31] — 2026-05-09 — Payment audit: 26 unrecorded claimers + 3 test voids

### Investigation — bot messages last 5 days
- Audited VPS webhook + pending logs + DB for all payment activity May 4–9
- Found **26 active tenants** who messaged bot claiming payment (text or image) with ₹0 in DB and Sheet
- 3 sent receipt images (rooms 218, 303, 314) — bot couldn't read them (Gemini 429 all month)
- 3 sent UPI screenshots (rooms 208, 302, 508) — not logged
- 4 flagged as non-May: 307 Sonali (April join), 409 Amisha (April payment), 412 Jatin (QR only), 512 Krish (UPI ID only)
- 9 tenants correctly recorded in DB and Sheet — no action needed
- Sheet confirmed = DB for all 26 (no discrepancy; Sheet is a live mirror)

### Data fix — voided 3 test payments (from May 6 golden suite run)
- Room 618 Priyanshi Rs.99,999 UPI (payment id=15131) — voided
- Room 203 Ronak Samriya Rs.15,000 UPI (payment id=15132) — voided
- Room 203 Ronak Samriya Rs.18,000 UPI (payment id=15133) — voided

### Pending action for Kiran
- Upload May Yes Bank CSV → Finance page → auto-match UPI credits → log confirmed payments via bot

## [1.75.30] — 2026-05-09 — Unit economics: Investment Return + Revenue Quality (Shark Tank-grade)

### New KPIs — Concept A: Investment Return (bank-gated)
- **Investment Yield %** — annualised EBITDA ÷ ₹2.59Cr; benchmarked vs FD (7%) and equity (12%) with ▲/▼ badges
- **Payback Period** — months (+ years) to recover full investment at current EBITDA run rate
- **Break-even Occupancy** — minimum occupancy % to cover OPEX; shows buffer above current occupancy

### New KPIs — Concept B: Revenue Quality (always visible)
- **Economic Occupancy %** — collected ÷ (total beds × avg rent); captures both vacancy and collection failure in one number
- **Revenue Leakage ₹** — billed but uncollected this month; color-coded by severity (green ≤10%, orange >20%)
- **RevPOB vs ADR gap** — bank revenue per occupied bed vs agreed rent; flags discounting if gap > 5%

### Files changed
- `src/services/unit_economics.py` — 5 new fields + `_TOTAL_INVESTMENT = 25_900_000` constant
- `web/lib/api.ts` — `UnitEconomics` interface extended with 5 new fields
- `web/components/finance/unit-economics-card.tsx` — 2 new card sections (Investment Return dark navy + Revenue Quality)

## [1.75.29] — 2026-05-09 — Fix delete tenant 500 (ORM cascade bug)

### Bug fix — delete tenant "Failed to fetch"
- **Root cause:** SQLAlchemy without `passive_deletes` issues `UPDATE payments SET tenancy_id=NULL` before deleting tenancy. `tenancy_id` is NOT NULL → IntegrityError → 500 with no CORS headers → browser reports "Failed to fetch"
- **Fix:** `delete_tenant` now uses raw SQL to delete child records in FK-safe order (checkout_sessions → checkout_records → rent_revisions → rent_schedule → payments → refunds → vacations → complaints), nullifies nullable FK tables (reminders, agreements, onboarding_sessions, documents), then deletes tenancy+tenant via raw SQL. ORM objects expunged to avoid identity map conflicts.
- **Deployed to VPS** — service restarted, verified 401 response with CORS headers on test DELETE

## [1.75.28] — 2026-05-09 — May room resolution + staff room flips (107 + G20)

### Data — room 107 + G20 flipped staff -> revenue
- Room 107 (THOR, 2-bed double): flipped `is_staff_room=false`; Samruddhi Thanwar (tenancy 1086) added, checkin 2026-05-07, rent 17,500, booking 52,000 cash
- G20 (HULK, 1-bed single): was already flipped in DB (Chandraprakash added May 2); docs and code had never been updated — fixed in this session
- **TOTAL_BEDS 294 → 297** (+1 G20, +2 room 107): updated in `gsheets.py`, `clean_and_load.py`, `gsheet_apps_script.js`, `gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js`
- Docs updated: `MASTER_DATA.md`, `BRAIN.md`, `BUSINESS_LOGIC.md`, `REPORTING.md`, `SHEET_LOGIC.md`, `memory/reference_master_data.md`
- Staff rooms: 8 → 6 (THOR: G05, G06, 108, 701, 702 | HULK: G12)

### Data — April/May gap investigation + resolutions
- Arjun Sumanth (tenancy 800, room 523) — marked exited checkout 2026-04-30 (was active in DB)
- 12 day-wise stays added via `_update_april_missing.py` (April day-wise tab)
- Lakshmi Pathi (tenancy 1083, room 219) — marked exited checkout 2026-05-07 (daily stay, status was stale active)
- Ganesh Magi (tenancy 869) — corrected room 219 -> 418 (data entry error)
- Arka (tenant 1011, tenancy 1088) — added to room 219, premium, checkin 2026-05-09, rent 25,000, May prorated 18,548, booking 5,000 UPI
- Nikhil Mistry (tenant 1012, tenancy 1089) — added then hard-deleted for clean onboarding link

### Scripts added
- `scripts/_find_april_missing_from_db.py` — investigation: compares April source sheet vs DB
- `scripts/_update_april_missing.py` — action: adds missing exits + day-wise stays
- `scripts/_resolve_may_rooms.py` — action: Lakshmi exit, Ganesh room move, Arka + Nikhil add

### Sheet sync
- May 2026 sheet re-synced: 277 rows, 282 beds (232 reg + 25 premium), 94.9% occ, 13 vacant

## [1.75.27] — 2026-05-09 — Delete tenant UX simplified + login autofill fix

### Changed: `web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`
- **Delete flow collapsed to 1 confirmation** — removed `forceDeleteNeeded` / `forceDeleteWarned` states and `handleForceDelete` function; now always calls `deleteTenant(..., force=true)`; one "Delete Tenant" → "Confirm Delete" tap, done
- Previous flow had 4 taps for tenants with payments; now 2 taps regardless of payment state
- "Failed to fetch" on force delete was caused by server error in force path (under investigation — check VPS logs when next needed)

### Fixed: `web/app/login/page.tsx`
- **Browser autofill no longer fails** — changed from React controlled inputs (`value=` + `onChange`) to uncontrolled refs; `emailRef` + `passwordRef` read DOM values at submit time
- Root cause: browser fills password field visually but never fires React `onChange`, so `password` state stayed `""`; submit sent empty password; clearing email and retyping was accidentally unblocking it via re-render cycle
- Email keeps `defaultValue="cozeevoemp1@gmail.com"`; no UX change, autofill now works immediately

## [1.75.26] — 2026-05-09 — Project reorganisation + LinkedIn brand project created

### Project move
- Copied PG Accountant from `C:\Users\kiran\Desktop\AI Watsapp PG Accountant` → `D:\Work\Claude Projects\AI Watsapp PG Accountant`
- Memory files copied to new Claude Code path (`d--Work-Claude-Projects-AI-Watsapp-PG-Accountant`)
- **Action needed:** Open from D drive next session → `git pull` → delete Desktop folder

### New project: LinkedIn Brand
- Created `D:\Work\Claude Projects\LinkedIn Brand\` as standalone project (own git repo)
- Full pipeline design spec written: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-linkedin-brand-pipeline-design.md`
- Stack: Claude Code pipeline → LinkedIn native scheduler (no Playwright bot risk)
- Audience: SAC consultants + decision-makers, Germany/DACH market, English with DACH context
- Cadence: 2 posts/week (Tue + Thu, 8 AM CET), one pipeline session/week
- Visual strategy: animated HTML diagrams (MP4) + Canva carousels + text-only, matched to content type
- Next: open LinkedIn Brand folder in Claude Code, run writing-plans to build implementation plan

## [1.75.25] — 2026-05-08 — Unit economics card redesign (investor-grade)

### Changed: `web/components/finance/unit-economics-card.tsx`
- **Hero tile** — dark bg, EBITDA/bed (large left) + EBITDA% margin (large right); impossible to miss
- **P&L Waterfall** — Gross Income → −Security Deposits → True Revenue (highlighted row) → −OPEX → EBITDA (green/red row with margin %)
- **Per-bed KPI tiles** — Rev/Bed · Cost/Bed · EBITDA% (only when bank CSV uploaded)
- **Occupancy progress bar** — color-coded (green ≥90%, amber ≥70%, red below) + vacant count
- **2-tile row** — Avg Rent/Bed + Collection Rate + collected-of-billed line
- Previous flat-list layout replaced; all data fields unchanged, presentation only

### Research: PG/co-living unit economics KPI concepts (presented, pending Kiran decision)
- Groups: RevPAB/RevPOB (per-bed revenue), Vacancy Cost/Economic Occupancy, OPEX Ratio, Payback Period/Annual Yield on Investment, Avg Stay Duration/Renewal Rate
- Kiran to select which groups to build next session

## [1.75.24] — 2026-05-08 — VPS security hardening

### Security fixes (no code changes — server config only)
- **UFW firewall enabled** — ports 8000 (FastAPI) and 3001 (Next.js) blocked from internet; only 22/80/443 open
- **SSH password auth disabled** — key-only login; brute force now impossible
- **PermitRootLogin → prohibit-password** — root SSH only via key
- **MaxAuthTries 3** — SSH limited to 3 attempts before disconnect
- **fail2ban installed** — 3 failed SSH attempts → 24h IP ban; nginx-botsearch + nginx-http-auth jails also active
- **`.env` permissions fixed** — was world-readable (644), now root-only (600)
- **Nginx security headers** — X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, server_tokens off

### Planned (pending Yes Bank API approval)
- Payment screenshot verification system (Claude vision → amount extraction → dues comparison → auto-log)
- Yes Bank transaction API integration for UTR verification (Kiran to apply at apiportal.yes.bank.in)

## [1.75.23] — 2026-05-07 — May payment audit via bot logs

### Analysis (no code changes)
- Grepped VPS webhook log for all payment-related messages in last 10 days
- Matched 38 tenant phones to active tenancies in DB
- Cross-checked against May 2026 `payments` table: 14 already in DB (12 full, 2 partial), 23 missing
- Inserted 19 confirmed payers → voided all 19 after discovering Gemini vision has been failing (429 rate limit) and screenshots are unverified
- 4 tenants flagged as ambiguous (307 Sonali, 409 Amisha, 412 Jatin, 512 Krish Kumar) — do not enter without manual verification

### Key findings
- Gemini vision (`receipt_handler._gemini_read_image`) has been hitting 429 rate limits all of May — zero payment screenshots read or saved to disk
- Bot receives images but they are processed in-memory only; on Gemini failure images are lost
- **Fix needed:** Replace Gemini with Claude vision in `receipt_handler.py`
- **Verification path for 19 tenants:** Upload May Yes Bank CSV → parser matches UPI credits to tenant phones → verified amounts

## [1.75.22] — 2026-05-06 — Unit economics KPIs — PWA + WhatsApp bot

### New: Unit Economics reporting (end-to-end)
- **`src/services/unit_economics.py`** — core service computing all KPIs from DB + bank_transactions:
  - Occupancy %, active tenants, avg agreed rent (True Rent — no deposits), collection rate
  - True Revenue, OPEX, EBITDA, revenue/bed, cost/bed, EBITDA/bed, EBITDA margin (only when bank CSV uploaded)
- **`GET /api/v2/app/finance/unit-economics?month=YYYY-MM`** — new admin-only API endpoint
- **`web/components/finance/unit-economics-card.tsx`** — new PWA card with two sections: Occupancy/Rent (always) + Per-Bed Unit Economics (when bank data available)
- **Finance page** (`web/app/finance/page.tsx`) — Unit Economics card added below P&L cards, loads on every month change
- **Bot intent `QUERY_UNIT_ECONOMICS`** — registered in `intent_detector.py` at confidence 0.95 before REPORT
  - Phrases: "unit economics", "revenue per bed", "cost per bed", "avg rent", "average bed rent", "collection rate", "unit kpi", "ebitda per bed", "property kpi"
- **Bot handler** `_query_unit_economics` in `account_handler.py` — formats all KPIs as WhatsApp-friendly text
- **`RECEPTIONIST_BLOCKED`** — QUERY_UNIT_ECONOMICS blocked from receptionist role (owner-only)
- **Docs updated**: REPORTING.md (section 11b), BOT_FLOWS.md, BRAIN.md, CLAUDE.md

## [1.75.21] — 2026-05-06 — Explicit audit standard + CI/CD testing requirement

### sop_session.md — wrap-up now requires explicit audit table
- Step 6 rewritten: every doc must be opened and verdict stated out loud — "Updated: [what]" or "No change needed: [reason]". Silent skips are a failed audit.
- Step 7 added: tests must be stated (golden suite pass count, smoke test, surface-specific checks). Failed tests block wrap-up until fixed or explicitly flagged in pending.
- "Wrap up done" definition updated: requires audit table to appear in the response.

### rules_impact_map.md — "Test with" column added
- Every change type now has a specific test: golden suite, curl endpoint, open Finance page, check Sheet, etc.
- Testing is part of the task, not deferred — same as CI blocking a merge on a failing test.

---

## [1.75.20] — 2026-05-06 — Memory system reorganised + docs audited + AI workflow guide

### Memory system — 70 files → ~35 files (halved)
- **27 individual feedback_*.md files deleted** — merged into 4 themed rule files:
  - `rules_financial.md` — dues formula, proration, billing, checkout, premium beds, rollover, exits, maintenance, late fee
  - `rules_data_sync.md` — sheet column refs, cash column integrity, DB-first, auto-refresh, daywise sync, import, all-outputs
  - `rules_bot_integrity.md` — no double-booking, handler completeness, side-effect audit, cross-layer consistency
  - `rules_workflow.md` — permissions, env, VPS deploy, model selection, testing, no-eraser, autocompact, staff room docs, PWA zindex
- **3 stale project files deleted**: project_pnl_session_2026_04_23.md (STALE), project_deprecate_add_tenant.md (shipped), project_checkout_form.md (shipped)
- **2 project files merged**: project_billing_rules.md → rules_financial.md; project_gsheet_sync.md → rules_data_sync.md
- **MEMORY.md rewritten** — clean table format with status column; purpose-per-type table at top
- **sop_session.md** — added "check before create" rule; BRAIN.md file-based trigger (not judgment-based); hardened wrap-up definition

### Process fixes — structural, not just rules
- **BRAIN.md trigger**: before every commit, run `git diff HEAD~1 --name-only`; if any file in BRAIN.md Key Files changed → update BRAIN.md same session. Eliminates 5-week staleness gap.
- **Wrap-up definition hardened**: "done" = CHANGELOG + all relevant docs updated + memory updated + committed + pushed + deployed. Every relevant doc on every change — no exceptions.

### New memory files
- `user_growth.md` — Kiran's working patterns, Claude's recurring mistakes log, friction points, improvement suggestions
- `user_ai_workflow.md` — how to prompt Claude effectively, session structure, correction patterns, anti-patterns, commands

### Docs audited and updated
- `docs/REPORTING.md` — Section 1 (P&L format) rewritten: bank-primary income, True Revenue = Gross − Security Deposits, CAPEX separate, cash position. Section 3/12: HULK beds discrepancy flagged.
- `docs/BRAIN.md` — last updated 2026-05-06; PWA pages list completed (Finance, Notices, Checkouts, Onboarding sessions, Edit Tenant added); Key Files expanded with pnl_builder.py, finance.py, yes_bank.py, PWA pages

## [1.75.19] — 2026-05-06 — P&L wrap-up: SOP update + doubtful tenants documented

### sop_pnl.md — fully updated to reflect new P&L logic
- **4-surface sync rule** — any P&L logic change must be applied to all four: `pnl_builder.py`, `_build_pnl_excel()`, `get_pnl()`, `pnl-cards.tsx + api.ts`. Rule now explicit in SOP header.
- **True Revenue formula** — `Total Gross Inflows − Security Deposits (refundable, active tenants, by check-in month)`. Maintenance fees NOT deducted. EBITDA = True Revenue − OPEX.
- **THOR→HULK reclassification** — pattern documented: show as explicit −₹5L THOR / +₹5L HULK rows in INCOME. Net zero. Not capital, not new income.
- **Cash position formula** — `Bank THOR+HULK − Net deposits owed (sec collected − refunded)`. Apr 30: Bank ₹21.88L − Deposits owed ₹28.91L = −₹7.02L true free cash.
- **Step 6 layout** updated with new income structure (Gross → Less: Security Deposits → True Revenue).
- **Step 10 checklist** updated with all new rules.

### May payments — additional import run
- Re-ran `scripts/_import_may_payments.py` against April collection sheet: 8 cash + 3 UPI new payments added (~₹88K). Idempotent — previously imported entries skipped.

### Doubtful tenants — 6 cases saved to memory/project_pending_tasks.md
- Prakashita (room 620), Vijay Kumar (room "June" = data error), Gayatri Kulkarni NM (514 vs 519), Ganesh Magi (418 vs 219), Covai (room 121 — no DB match), Abhishek Vishwakarma (room 121 — April dues unpaid).

---

## [1.75.18] — 2026-05-06 — P&L deposit deduction corrected + cash position

### Deposit deduction — correct amount (refundable security only ~₹33L not ₹61L)
- **Root cause of double**: was using `DEPOSIT_RECEIVED` (security + maintenance = ₹61.6L). Correct: only refundable security deposits = ₹33.21L.
- `pnl_builder.py`: deduct `DEPOSITS["Security Deposits — refundable"]` per month. True Rent Revenue = ₹1,20,36,738. EBITDA = ₹18.26L (15.2%). Net = ₹1.92L.
- `finance.py _build_pnl_excel()`: same logic — deducts `dep_held_sec` from gross, EBITDA on true revenue. Removed duplicate DEPOSITS HELD section.
- Maintenance fee (non-refundable, ₹10.7L) kept in income — shown as informational note only.

### THOR→HULK ₹5L inter-account transfer — explicit reclassification
- Removed from Capital Contributions (it's not new equity — already in THOR income).
- INCOME section now shows: `THOR — transferred to HULK (reclassification): −₹5L` and `HULK — received from THOR (reclassification): +₹5L`. Net = zero on combined total. Per-building attribution correct for tax.

### Property rent — corrected back to ₹13,000 × 164 = ₹21,32,000
- Was incorrectly changed to ₹13,500 × 164 mid-session. Reverted.

### Cash position — filled with actual numbers
- Bank THOR + HULK = ₹21,88,804. Net deposits owed to active tenants = ₹28,91,500.
- True free cash = −₹7,02,696 (bank < deposits owed — gap funded by early CAPEX/OPEX).
- Note added: gap recovers as revenue grows (Apr EBITDA ₹14.78L/month).

---

## [1.75.17] — 2026-05-06 — P&L structure final + bank_transactions dedup

### P&L — correct structure across all surfaces
- **Deposit deduction reverted** — deposits were never in income (DB confirmed: zero deposit payments in payments table for Oct–Apr; zero "Advance Deposit" bank transactions). Subtracting them gave false negative EBITDA. Structure: Gross Inflows → DEPOSITS HELD (context, not deducted) → OPEX → EBITDA → CAPEX → Net Profit.
- **DEPOSITS HELD moved to right after income** in both `pnl_builder.py` and `_build_pnl_excel()` — visible context of cash held on behalf of tenants, before OPEX.
- **EBITDA label** added to Operating Profit row in both Excel surfaces.
- **"Advance Deposit" bank transactions excluded from income** — `get_pnl()` SQL query now filters out `category = 'Advance Deposit'`; `_build_pnl_excel()` loop skips them. Defensive fix for future deposits paid via bank.
- **Total label clarified** — "Total Gross Inflows (rent only — deposits excluded)" in Excel header.

### bank_transactions dedup
- **Deleted 999 duplicate rows** — upload_id=2 (243 rows, Jan 2026 only) and upload_id=4 (756 rows, Jan–Mar 2026) were fully covered by the NULL-upload dataset (comprehensive Oct'25–May'26). January income was 3× inflated in live P&L before this fix.
- Remaining: 1,603 rows (NULL upload 1343 + upload_id=6 April data 260).

### Rent increase (June 2026)
- ₹500/bed increase effective June 2026. Noted in memory for next billing cycle.

---

## [1.75.16] — 2026-05-06 — P&L structure cleanup + non-operating audit

### P&L — deposit adjustment removed, structure simplified
- **Removed DEPOSIT ADJUSTMENT section** from income — was confusing alongside DEPOSITS HELD. Income now shows gross inflows only. Operating Profit computed on gross.
- **DEPOSITS HELD moved before CAPEX** — now appears between Operating Profit and CAPEX for better reading flow.
- **All 4 surfaces updated**: `pnl_builder.py` (verified Excel), `_build_pnl_excel()` (live Excel), `get_pnl()` (JSON), `pnl-cards.tsx` + `api.ts` (PWA Finance page).
- **Excel saved** to `data/reports/PnL_Cozeevo_v2_clean.xlsx`.

### Investigations completed this session
- **Deposits confirmed NOT in bank income** — DB query: all ₹40.4L in deposits paid via CASH (273 entries, zero via UPI/bank). ₹35.13L net profit is not inflated by deposits.
- **₹5L THOR→HULK correctly handled** — Capital Contributions on HULK side, Excluded on THOR side. Does not affect profit either way.
- **Non-operating transactions audited** — ₹32.12L total across 7 months shown in EXCLUDED section (not deducted from profit). Duplicate rows found in DB for most entries (total appears as ₹65.6L in DB vs ₹32.8L actual).
- **March ₹20.9L breakdown identified**: ₹5L THOR→HULK (Bharathi), ₹7.5L Vakkalagadda Sravani "money exchange" (unclear), ₹2L Bharathi RTGS, ₹40K UPI to shalu.pravi2125, ₹6L Sri Lakshmi Chandrasekar.

### Pending from this session — carry to next
- Duplicate bank_transactions rows in DB — almost every non-operating entry appears twice; need dedup before live Excel is reliable
- Kiran to identify: ₹7.5L "Vakkalagadda Sravani — money exchange" (Mar 10), ₹6L Sri Lakshmi Chandrasekar (Feb + Mar), ₹2L Bharathi Mar RTGS
- Decide: add Non-Operating Outflows line below Net Profit to show cash impact of ₹32.12L transfers

---

## [1.75.15] — 2026-05-06 — P&L HULK integration + deposit structure overhaul

### P&L — all 4 surfaces now consistent
- **Deposit adjustment** added to income section: Gross Inflows → Deposit Adjustment (recv/refunded) → True Revenue. Operating Profit based on True Revenue, not gross.
- **CAPEX + excluded items** no longer inflate `total_expense` on Finance page JSON (`get_pnl()`).
- **All 4 surfaces consistent**: local Excel, `/finance/pnl/excel` (verified), `/finance/pnl/live`, Finance page JSON.

### HULK building incorporated
- **`AccountSummary Cozeevo hulk.pdf`** extracted (32 rows, Mar–May 2026, acct ...0881). `bank_statement_extractor.py` updated with `--password` flag for encrypted PDFs.
- **`pnl_builder.py`** — renamed THOR income lines; added HULK UPI settlements (Apr ₹2.47L), HULK cheque (Mar ₹71.5K), HULK opex (Apr ₹4.3K), THOR→HULK inter-account transfer capital (Mar ₹5L). Bank closing balance split into THOR (₹13.7L) + HULK (₹8.1L).
- **32 HULK transactions inserted** into `bank_transactions` (account_name=HULK). Bharathi RTGS/NEFT transfers reclassified as Non-Operating (inter-account, not income).

### DEPOSITS HELD — fixed and split by check-in month
- Security deposits now split by check-in month (active tenants only) in both `pnl_builder.py` and live Excel. Was incorrectly lumped in April.
- Source: DB query 2026-05-06. Security refundable = ₹33.2L; maintenance retained = ₹10.7L.
- Live Excel (`/finance/pnl/live`) now has full DEPOSITS HELD section — was missing entirely.

---

## [1.75.14] — 2026-05-06 — May 2026 full data load

### May data import
- **`scripts/_import_may_payments.py --write`** — 5 new payments committed (Satvik Suresh cash ₹12,500; Gnanesh UPI ₹13,000; Shivam Nath cash ₹15,000; Abhishek Charan UPI ₹19,066; Prakashita UPI ₹17,750 — phone typo fix, sheet 7275 vs DB 7375). 135 already in DB skipped.
- **`scripts/_add_missing_may_tenants.py`** — 4 long-term tenants added to DB (missing from system):
  - Chandraprakash (G20, tenancy 1078) — active May 2, rent ₹22k, cash ₹28k rent + UPI ₹5k booking
  - Mathew Koshy (304, tenancy 1079) — active May 3, rent ₹28k, UPI ₹44k rent + cash ₹2k booking
  - Rama Krishnan (G09, tenancy 1080) — no_show, check-in June 1, rent ₹9k, UPI ₹2k booking
  - Akshitha Jawahar (214, tenancy 1081) — active May 3, rent ₹15k, UPI ₹2k booking (May rent unpaid)
- **G20 reclassified** — `is_staff_room=false` in DB (Chandraprakash is regular tenant)
- **`scripts/_add_daywise_may.py`** — 4 day-wise tenants added:
  - Rayirth (G18, tenancy 1082) — active May 3–15, ₹1k/day, ₹1k cash
  - Lakshmi Pathi (219, tenancy 1083) — no_show May 4–6, ₹1.2k booking
  - Chinchu David (G17, tenancy 1084) — no_show May 4–6, ₹3.1k UPI (500 discount)
  - Avirneni Karthik (510, tenancy 1085) — active May 6–25, ₹700/day, ₹2.6k UPI
  - Shashank B V (G18) stale active record fixed → exited (Apr 28)
- **TENANTS master tab** — 5 rows appended via `resync_missing_tenants_to_sheet.py`
- **Ops sheet resynced** — MAY 2026: Cash ₹13,05,800 · UPI ₹13,27,565 · Collected ₹26,33,365 · Occ 94.6%
- **DAY WISE tab resynced** — 42 rows, 2 active today

### Pending (next data load)
- Covai (room 121) — no phone, room full in DB; ask Kiran which room
- Vijay Kumar — room "June" data error in source sheet; ask Kiran actual room
- Prem Prasana — blacklisted, moved out May 6, cleared dues (correct)

---

## [1.75.13] — 2026-05-06 — Blacklist system + reminders paused

### Blacklist (complete feature)
- **`blacklist` DB table** — id, name, phone, reason, added_by, is_active, created_at. Soft-delete via `is_active`. Migration added to `migrate_all.py`.
- **`src/services/blacklist.py`** — shared service: `check_blacklisted()` (fuzzy name + last-10-digit phone), `add_to_blacklist()`, `list_blacklist()`, `remove_from_blacklist()`.
- **`src/api/v2/blacklist.py`** — REST API: `GET /blacklist` (list), `POST /blacklist` (add), `DELETE /blacklist/{id}` (soft-delete). Registered in `app_router.py`.
- **Onboarding guard** — check at session CREATE (phone) and session APPROVE (name + phone). Returns HTTP 403 with reason if matched.
- **Bot commands** (owner/admin only):
  - `blacklist [name] — [reason]` → adds with reason
  - `blacklist [name]` → prompts for reason (multi-turn)
  - `show blacklist` → lists all active entries with ID, name, phone, reason
  - `remove blacklist [name or ID]` → confirmation flow; multiple matches → numbered pick → confirm → remove
- **Full E2E tested**: 28/28 tests passing — add, show, remove by ID, remove by name, fuzzy disambiguation, cancel flows, edge cases (not found, already removed, partial name match).
- **Prem Prasana** added to blacklist: "Do not admit — flagged by owner."

### Reminders paused
- `REMINDERS_PAUSED=1` in VPS `.env` — all rent reminder jobs check this flag and skip silently. Re-enable: `sed -i '/REMINDERS_PAUSED/d' /opt/pg-accountant/.env && systemctl restart pg-accountant`.

### Fixes (found during blacklist E2E)
- `migrate_all.py` — two `→` Unicode chars replaced with `->` (crashed Windows console with charmap error)
- `intent_detector.py` — BLACKLIST_REMOVE listed before BLACKLIST_ADD; `\b` word boundaries on `blacklist`/`block`/`ban` so "unblacklist" no longer triggers ADD
- `owner_handler.py` — `entities["_raw_message"]` (was `entities["raw"]`); `is_affirmative()` (was `is_positive()`)

---

## [1.75.12] — 2026-05-06 — Balance Adjustment PWA + UPDATE_SHARING_TYPE bot fix

### PWA
- **Balance Adjustment section** on Edit Tenant page — toggle Waive/Add Charge, amount, required reason, live preview of new effective due, two-tap confirm. Separate save flow (doesn't affect main tenant edit form).
- **Credit balance display** — shows "Credit ₹X" badge when tenant has paid more than effective due.
- **Existing adjustment display** — shows current adjustment and note inline (green for waive, amber for surcharge).

### Backend
- **`PATCH /api/v2/app/tenants/{id}/adjustment`** — new endpoint sets `RentSchedule.adjustment` and `adjustment_note` for current month. Positive = surcharge, negative = waive. Writes AuditLog. Triggers sheet sync (monthly or day-wise based on stay type).
- **`GET /api/v2/app/tenants/{id}/dues`** — now returns `credit`, `rent_due`, `adjustment`, `adjustment_note`, `booking_amount` fields. `credit = max(paid - effective_due, 0)`.
- **`lib/api.ts`** — added `patchAdjustment()`, `AdjustmentResult` type. Extended `TenantDues` interface with all new fields.

### Bot fix (UPDATE_SHARING_TYPE context loss — from screenshot)
- **`intent_detector.py` line 154** — regex now matches "change [room] to [type] sharing" word order (previously only matched "sharing to [type]" order, causing Groq fallback with no pending state saved → "1" response lost).
- **`update_handler.py` update_sharing_type()** — now extracts room number from message and tries room-number lookup before name lookup. Added `_find_active_tenants_by_room` to top-level import.

### Test
- Golden suite: 79/105 passing (up from 76/105) — 0 regressions from this session.
- Root cause of 93-failure run found: `TEST_MODE=0` on VPS meant `clear-pending` endpoint was never registered, so pending state from one test bled into all subsequent tests. Fixed for this run by temporarily flipping TEST_MODE=1, clearing all pending, then restoring.

---

## [1.75.11] — 2026-05-05 — May 2026 payment import (bulk, from April source sheet)

### Data
- **May 2026 payments imported** — ran `scripts/_import_may_payments.py --write` against April source sheet (1Vr_...) columns Z (MAY UPI) / AA (MAY Cash)
- **87 new payments committed**: Cash ₹7,85,450 + UPI ₹4,89,750 (54 already existed from prior run on 2026-05-03)
- **1 RS auto-created** for T.Rakesh Chetan (room 415) — tenancy existed, no May rent_schedule row
- **May sheet resynced** — `sync_sheet_from_db.py --write --month 5 --year 2026`; 271 rows, Cash ₹12,50,300 / UPI ₹11,00,750 / Collected ₹23,51,050 / Dues ₹18,54,887; 117 paid, 136 partial

### Skipped (no DB match — handle separately)
- Prakashita room 620 (+917275547390)
- Chandraprakash room G20 (+919506064442) — blocked on G20 reclassification
- Mathew Koshy room 304 (+919446655101)
- Rama Krishnan room G09 (+919842378754)
- Vijay Kumar (room listed "June" in sheet — data error)
- Akshitha Jawahar room 214 (+919500006551)

### Room mismatches (payment recorded to DB room)
- Gayatri Kulkarni NM: sheet 514, DB 519
- Ganesh Magi: sheet 418, DB 219

---

## [1.75.10] — 2026-05-03 — Finance: shared P&L builder + two download buttons + DB fully loaded

### Added
- **`src/reports/pnl_builder.py`** — canonical P&L builder (hardcoded verified Oct'25–Apr'26 figures). Single source of truth shared by the local export script and the PWA API endpoint — both produce identical Excel output.
- **`GET /finance/pnl/excel`** — now serves the verified canonical P&L from `pnl_builder.py` (not DB-computed). Same file as `data/reports/PnL_Accrual_2026_05_03.xlsx`.
- **`GET /finance/pnl/live`** — new endpoint: recomputes P&L on-the-fly from DB, reclassifying all transactions with current classifier rules. Picks up any new CSV uploads (HULK, new months).
- **PWA Finance page — two download buttons:**
  - `↓ P&L Report (Oct'25–Apr'26)` — verified canonical, fast, no DB query
  - `↓ Recalculate from Latest Uploads` — live from DB, picks up new statements

### Changed
- **`scripts/export_pnl_2026_05_02.py`** — now delegates to `pnl_builder.build_pnl_workbook()` (was duplicate code). Running locally produces identical output to downloading from the PWA.
- **`scripts/import_thor_to_db.py`** — `ON CONFLICT (unique_hash) DO NOTHING` replaces manual hash-set pre-check; idempotent and safe to re-run.

### Verified
- **DB fully loaded**: THOR Oct'25–Apr'26 (all 7 months) confirmed in `bank_transactions`. Oct: 4 rows, Nov: 83, Dec: 209, Jan: 728, Feb: 488, Mar: 538, Apr: 520.

---

## [1.75.9] — 2026-05-03 — PWA: Recent Check-ins home section + payment deep-link

### Added
- **`GET /api/v2/app/activity/recent-checkins`** — new endpoint (`src/api/v2/kpi.py`); returns active tenants checked in within last 45 days with first-month due/paid/balance (reads RentSchedule for due, sums rent payments for period)
- **`RecentCheckins` component** (`web/components/home/recent-checkins.tsx`) — green avatar + "Paid" badge when cleared; orange avatar + "₹X due" when balance remains; tapping unpaid/partial → `/payment/new?tenancy_id=`; tapping paid → `/tenants/{id}/edit`
- **Home page "Recent check-ins" section** (`web/app/page.tsx`) — server-prefetched alongside KPI data; appears between quick links and Recent Payments

### Changed
- **Payment page** (`web/app/payment/new/page.tsx`) — accepts `?tenancy_id=` query param; auto-loads tenant + dues + pre-fills amount on page load (uses `window.location.search` to avoid Next.js Suspense requirement)

### DB fix
- **Abhinav Rastogi (1073) + Chaitanya Prashant Talokar (1074), Room 407** — `rent_due` corrected from ₹17,379 (prorated from May 3) to ₹18,250 (full month: ₹13,500 + ₹6,750 deposit − ₹2,000 booking). Both checked in today; full month agreed.

---

## [1.75.8] — 2026-05-03 — Fix: Check-ins today KPI only shows pending arrivals

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — `checkins_today` count + detail queries now filter `status == no_show` only. Previously showed ALL tenancies with `checkin_date == today` regardless of status, so already-checked-in (`active`) tenants kept reappearing in the tile after physical check-in.
- **DB fix** — Abhinav Rastogi (tenancy 1073) and Chaitanya Prashant Talokar (tenancy 1074), Room 407, were `active` with only booking advance paid (no physical check-in done). Reverted both to `no_show` so they appear correctly in the "Check-ins today" tile pending physical arrival.

---

## [1.75.7] — 2026-05-03 — P&L classifier: bulk reclassification + check-in toggle + P&L regenerated

### Changed — `src/rules/pnl_classify.py`
- **Prabhakaran (9444296681)** → Staff & Labour "Salary - Prabhakaran" (was Other Expenses)
- **Basavaraju (bn.basavaraju)** → Maintenance & Repairs "EB Panel Board - Basavaraju"
- **Plumbers** — chandan865858 + kumar.ranjan7828 added to Maintenance & Repairs "Plumbing"
- **Naukri (naukri.qr8.payu@indus)** → Operational Expenses "Job Posting - Naukri"
- **Atta mixing machine (naveenmanly100100)** → Operational Expenses
- **Chairs & study tables (q962933392)** → Operational Expenses
- **Kitchen equipment (9844532900@okbizaxis)** → Operational Expenses
- **Deposit refunds** added: Shubhi Vishnoi (6391679333), Bharath cancelled (6379442910), Shashank B V (9482874334) → Tenant Deposit Refund

### Changed — `scripts/export_pnl_2026_05_02.py` + P&L Excel
- All bank-derived rows updated from fresh classifier run
- Staff & Labour Apr: 1,56,102 → 1,99,617 (+Prabhakaran salary)
- Operational Expenses Apr: 30,756 → 1,37,319 (+chairs 47K + kitchen 37.5K + atta 21K + naukri 1K)
- CAPEX Furniture & Fittings Apr: 2,11,183 → 2,163 (chairs/kitchen/atta moved to Opex)
- Other Expenses: Jan 6,564→4,564 / Feb 23,308→23,258 / Apr 99,515→99,306
- Tenant Deposit Refund: Jan +2K (Bharath), Apr +Shubhi+Shashank
- Output: `data/reports/PnL_Accrual_2026_05_03.xlsx`

### Added — PWA check-in form
- **Full/Prorated toggle** on check-in form (same as Edit Tenant page)
- Backend: `GET /checkin-preview?prorate=true/false` + `POST /checkin` accepts `prorate` field
- Frontend: `prorateChoice` state, pill toggle UI, dynamic rent row label

---

## [1.75.6] — 2026-05-03 — Finance fixes: dedup hash alignment + INR rupee format

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/finance.py`** — `_make_hash` formula now matches `finance_handler.py` exactly (`date|desc[:80]|amount`). Old formula had different field order (`date|amount|desc`), causing re-uploads of records already inserted via WhatsApp to create duplicates instead of being skipped.
- **`src/utils/inr_format.py`** — `INR_NUMBER_FORMAT` updated to conditional format with ₹ symbol: `[>9999999][$₹]##\,##\,##\,##0;[>99999][$₹]##\,##\,##0;[$₹]##,##0`. Propagates automatically to Finance Excel download and `export_classified.py`.

---

## [1.75.5] — 2026-05-03 — PWA stability fixes: login, room transfer, KPI totals

### Fixed
- **PWA login stuck / page not loading** — Supabase auth middleware threw unhandled `AuthRetryableFetchError` (504 timeout); added try/catch + 3s `Promise.race` timeout so pages always load even when Supabase auth is slow
- **Login form hang** — `signInWithEmail` had no timeout; button stayed on "Signing in…" forever; added 10s timeout with "Connection timed out" error message
- **Room transfer "Failed to fetch"** — `tenancy.property_id` doesn't exist on `Tenancy` model (only `room_id`); changed to `room.property_id` (current room already joined in query)
- **Room transfer "Room X not found" for Room 000 tenants** — room lookup was filtering by `property_id` of the current room; placeholder rooms like "000" have NULL `property_id`, so lookup matched nothing; removed `property_id` filter entirely — room numbers are unique system-wide; matches how `execute_room_transfer` (the bot service) works
- **Confirmed no other `tenancy.property_id` wrong-attr bugs** in codebase (grepped all of `src/` and `services/`)
- **Backend was down** — `pg-accountant` service had failed; restarted

### Added
- **KPI expansion panel totals** — right-aligned pink label inline with filter chips: vacant shows actual bed count (summed from "N beds free" detail string, not room count), dues shows ₹ total, occupied shows tenant count, others show item count

### Changed
- **Confirmation modal centered** — was a bottom sheet (`items-end`); now centered on screen (`items-center`) with `rounded-[28px]`; fields area scrollable; buttons pinned to bottom; max-h 85vh

---

## [1.75.3] — 2026-05-03 — May 2026 payment import from source sheet (Z/AA columns)

### Data
- **Source sheet columns Z (MAY UPI) + AA (MAY Cash)** identified as May 2026 collection data added by Kiran to the April source sheet (1Vr_...)
- **24 missing May rent payments imported** — 10 cash ₹2,14,850 + 14 UPI ₹2,01,000; script skipped 12 already in DB
- **Ajay Mohan (room 516) ₹37,000 cash** added manually — duplicate tenant record (id=920 vs 921, same phone) caused import script to hit wrong record; duplicate deleted
- **May 2026 sheet resynced** — Ops Sheet now shows Cash ₹3,67,850 / UPI ₹3,01,000 / Total ₹6,68,850
- **4 pending onboarding sessions bulk-cancelled** (Delvin Raj, + 3 pending_tenant)
- **Duplicate Ajay Mohan tenant (id=920) deleted** — no tenancy, safe removal

### Added
- `scripts/_import_may_payments.py` — reusable script to import monthly cash/UPI payments from source sheet columns by index; dry-run + --write; detects room mismatches + missing tenants

### Outstanding (not imported)
- Chandraprakash (G20) ₹28,000 cash + ₹5,000 UPI — no tenant in DB; blocked pending G20 room reclassification
- Delvin Raj — room 520 full (2/2); needs room reassignment before onboarding

---

## [1.75.4] — 2026-05-03 — PWA: force delete fix + check-in date edit + upcoming booking badge

### Fixed
- **Force delete** — payments in frozen months (April etc.) caused "FROZEN" DB trigger error; now sets `SET LOCAL app.allow_historical_write = 'true'` before voiding, so force delete works for any tenant regardless of payment period

### Added
- **Check-in date field in Edit Tenant** — pre-filled from DB, editable, appears in Stay Details section above Lock-in; saves via PATCH; shows in confirmation card when changed
- **Upcoming booking badge on Vacant Beds panel** — rooms with future no-show bookings (checkin_date > today) now show amber "Booked DD Mon" badge; bed still counts as vacant until that date

---

## [1.75.2] — 2026-05-03 — PWA: delete tenant from edit page (reason + force delete)

### Added
- **`DELETE /api/v2/app/tenants/{id}`** — hard-deletes tenancy + tenant; requires `?reason=`; blocked if payments exist unless `?force=true` which voids all payments first; AuditLog entry written before deletion
- **Edit Tenant page** — Danger Zone section: preset reason chips (Cancelled / Wrong / Double booking / Other), two-tap confirm, force delete button revealed on 409

---

## [1.75.1] — 2026-05-03 — PWA edge case hardening

### Fixed
- Phone uniqueness check in PATCH (409 vs silent DB crash); AuditLog on room change via edit page; floor validation (rent > 0, deposit/maintenance/lock-in ≥ 0) in PATCH + onboarding; CTA disabled when destination room full; email pre-filled in edit form; checkout deductions warning + unpaid dues two-tap gate; transfer-room RS now prorated by remaining days

---

## [1.75.0] — 2026-05-03 — Finance / P&L page: CSV upload, P&L dashboard, Excel download, deposit reconciliation

### Added
- **`src/parsers/yes_bank.py`** — `read_yes_bank_csv()` parser extracted from `export_classified.py`; accepts str path, bytes, or file-like IO
- **`src/api/v2/finance.py`** — 4 new endpoints (admin-only):
  - `POST /finance/upload` — multi-file CSV upload (THOR/HULK account selector), classify + dedup via SHA256 hash, auto-reconcile deposit refunds on upload
  - `GET /finance/pnl?month=YYYY-MM` — income (bank UPI batch + direct/NEFT + DB cash) + expenses by category + capital + operating profit + margin %
  - `GET /finance/pnl/excel?from=&to=` — 3-sheet Excel download (Monthly P&L, Sub-category Breakdown, All Transactions) matching existing report format
  - `GET /finance/reconcile?month=YYYY-MM` — deposit refund rows with matched/unmatched status and tenant name
- **`web/app/finance/page.tsx`** — Finance dashboard: month picker, KPI tiles, income/expense cards, upload card, reconciliation card, Excel download button
- **`web/components/finance/pnl-cards.tsx`** — `KpiTiles`, `IncomeCard`, `ExpenseCard`
- **`web/components/finance/upload-card.tsx`** — THOR/HULK selector + multi-file CSV upload
- **`web/components/finance/reconcile-card.tsx`** — deposit refund rows with matched(green)/unmatched(orange) badges
- **`web/app/page.tsx`** — admin-only Finance & P&L quick link on home page

### Changed
- **`src/database/models.py`** — `BankUpload` + `BankTransaction` get `account_name VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'THOR'`; `BankTransaction` gets `reconciled_checkout_id` nullable FK → `checkout_records.id`
- **`src/database/migrate_all.py`** — 3 new migration entries appended
- **`scripts/export_classified.py`** — imports `parse_date`, `parse_amt`, `read_yes_bank_csv` from new parser module (no logic change)
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — finance API client: `uploadBankCsv`, `getFinancePnl`, `downloadPnlExcel`, `getDepositReconciliation` + 6 TypeScript interfaces

### Deployed
- All 3 DB migrations applied on VPS (account_name × 2 + reconciled_checkout_id)
- API + PWA restarted and healthy

---

## [1.74.38] — 2026-05-03 — PWA edge case fixes: validation, audit log, email pre-fill, checkout guards

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — PATCH endpoint:
  - Phone uniqueness: checks for duplicate before writing; returns 409 with clear message instead of silent DB constraint crash
  - AuditLog entry now written on room change via edit page (was missing — only `/transfer-room` logged it)
  - Floor validation: `agreed_rent` must be > 0; `security_deposit`, `maintenance_fee`, `lock_in_months` cannot be negative — returns 422
  - `email` added to `GET /tenants/{id}/dues` response so edit page can pre-fill it
  - Imported `AuditLog` model (was missing from imports)
- **`src/api/onboarding_router.py`** — `/create` endpoint: same floor checks for `agreed_rent`, `security_deposit`, `maintenance_fee`, `daily_rate`
- **`services/room_transfer.py`** — `execute_room_transfer()`: RS update now runs on every room transfer (was only when rent changed); applies prorated `remaining_days / days_in_month` math instead of always writing full rent
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`**:
  - "Review Changes" CTA disabled (`opacity-40`, `cursor-not-allowed`) when destination room is full
  - Email field pre-filled from API response on load
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`**:
  - Deductions > deposit shows inline warning ("surplus not charged, refund will be ₹0")
  - Unpaid dues gate: first tap shows warning + blocks; second tap proceeds (two-tap confirm pattern)
  - Added `duesWarned` state, reset on tenant change
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `TenantDues` interface: added `email: string` field

---

## [1.74.37] — 2026-05-03 — PWA UX: KPI overlay panels + instant open + recent payments search/sort

### Changed
- **`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`** — KPI expansion panel completely reworked:
  - Panel now **floats as absolute overlay** below the clicked tile instead of pushing content down
  - Left-column tiles: overlay spans both columns anchored left; right-column: anchored right; full-width: left-right
  - **Transparent backdrop** (`fixed inset-0 z-10`) — tapping anywhere outside closes the panel
  - **150ms open animation** (`panel-in` keyframe: translateY -6px + scale 0.97 → normal)
  - **Instant open (server-side prefetch)**: all KPI detail data now fetched server-side in `page.tsx` alongside KPI counts; cache pre-populated before page reaches browser — zero client-side API call on tile tap
  - Mount-time client prefetch now skips tiles with count=0 (no wasted API calls on quiet days)
- **`web/app/page.tsx`** — fetches all visible KPI details in parallel during SSR; passes `initialDetails` prop to `KpiGrid`
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `getKpiDetail` accepts optional `token` for server-side use
- **`web/components/home/activity-feed.tsx`** — converted to client component; added name/room search + newest/oldest sort toggle
- **`web/components/ui/tab-bar.tsx`** — regular buttons `w-11→w-12`, CTA `w-12→w-14`, pill padding `py-2→py-2.5`
- **`web/app/collection/breakdown/page.tsx`** — month nav arrows now `w-11 h-11` (44px touch target, was `px-1`)
- **`web/app/globals.css`** — added `@keyframes panel-in`

---

## [1.74.36] — 2026-05-02 — P&L layout restructured + CAPEX separated

### Changed
- **`scripts/export_pnl_2026_05_02.py` — layout overhaul**:
  - CAPEX (Furniture & Fittings, 8 Ball Pool) moved out of opex → own section below Operating Profit
  - New profit lines: Operating Profit / Operating Margin % → CAPEX → Net Profit After CAPEX / Net Margin %
  - Capital Contributions moved to below Income section
  - Excluded items (deposit refunds, loan repayments) shown inline below opex
  - Bank credits reconciliation section removed (confusing, no actionable value)
- **Corrections**: Nov ₹50,000 in Furniture & Fittings was loan repayment — moved to Loan Repayment (excluded)
- **Property rent shifted to cash basis**: Jan rent paid Feb, Feb in Mar, Mar in Apr (Apr rent paid May is outside window)
- **Water shifted to cash basis**: Mar = ₹8K tanker only; Apr = ₹84,520 (tanker ₹42,020 + Manoj Mar bill ₹42,500)
- **8 Ball Pool Equipment**: renamed from "CCTV Installation" — Nov ₹82,000
- **Flags cleaned up**: all confirmed items resolved; only 2 open (Manoj Apr water TBD, Apr rent outside window)

---

## [1.74.35] — 2026-05-02 — P&L rebuilt from bank statement as primary income source

### Changed
- **`scripts/export_pnl_2026_05_02.py` — income methodology** — completely rebuilt:
  - Primary source: bank statement credits (batch UPI settlements + individual direct UPI + NEFT)
  - Supplementary: DB cash payments (physical cash not deposited to bank)
  - Maintenance fee removed from income — shown in Deposits Held section only
  - Capital correctly separated (Lakshmi SBI→Yes Bank startup ₹5L Oct; Kiran top-up ₹90K Jan)
- **Bank classifier fixed** — old classifier put ALL individual UPI as "Capital/Personal" because partner's number appeared as *recipient* in every credit description. Fixed: now checks if admin is the *sender* (from: field), not just mentioned. Oct–Dec income was severely understated before.
- **Verified against Dec closing balance** — Oct–Dec net credits−debits = ₹13,76,417 = bank statement Dec closing balance ✓

### Corrected figures (Oct–Apr)
| Month | Old Income (DB) | New Income (Bank+Cash) |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| Oct | ₹0 | ₹0 (all capital) |
| Nov | ₹96K maint fee | ₹7,23,007 |
| Dec | ₹1,96K maint fee | ₹13,50,547 |
| Jan | ₹11,32,647 | ₹15,59,796 |
| Feb | ₹32,53,396 | ₹31,65,587 |
| Mar | ₹43,11,127 | ₹38,34,586 |
| Apr | ₹46,61,148 | ₹44,05,321 |

---

## [1.74.34] — 2026-05-02 — Full reconciliation: Source = Ops = DB for Nov'25–Apr'26

### Fixed
- **P&L income numbers corrected** — `scripts/export_pnl_2026_05_02.py` fixed against THOR history source sheet: Nov/Dec=0 (no data), Jan UPI corrected to 530,575 (was 1,335,224)
- **Dec 2025 extra voided** — voided 1 erroneous payment (12,800) via `_void_extra.py`
- **Mar 2026 extra voided** — voided 8-entry 12:xx batch (124,500) inserted Apr 27; approved batch (14:xx, 259 rows, 3,983,413) retained
- **April 2026 reconciled** — voided 10 mismatched payments; un-voided Ashmit; added Navdeep +11,600, Nithin Krishna +2,516, Priyansh +16,000; added Siddharth Linge UPI 2,400; created tenants Delvin Raj (id=994) + Suraj SH (id=995) in room 000 with April payments
- **Fixed NULL is_void** — 3 inserted records had is_void=NULL; patched via `_fix_null_voids.py`
- **Ops sheet COLLECTION rows updated** — March and April COLLECTION cells patched to match DB totals (March was +124,500 stale; April was -23,016 stale)
- **Audit script parse fix** — `_audit_all_months.py` parse() now rejects text notes ("19500/6500", "13000 Received by...") that corrupted March source total

### Result
All months Nov'25–Apr'26: Source = Ops sheet = DB. Zero diffs across all three sources.

---

## [1.74.33] — 2026-05-02 — Overdue reminder uses rent_reminder template (not general_notice)

### Changed
- **`src/scheduler.py` — `overdue_daily` mode** — days 1, 3, 5 now send `rent_reminder` (`{{name}}` only, no amount or late-fee text). `general_notice` reserved for when Kiran enables it.

---

## [1.74.32] — 2026-05-02 — Onboarding UX + reminder template sync

### Added
- **Onboarding sessions — search bar** — filter by name, room, or phone number (client-side, instant)
- **Onboarding sessions — two-tap confirm buttons** — replaced `window.confirm()` (silently blocked on mobile PWA) with inline "Tap again to confirm" pattern for Approve and Cancel; error toasts now show 5–6s instead of 2.5s

### Fixed
- **13 orphan draft sessions cleaned** — cancelled in DB with reason `auto-cleaned: orphan draft`; draft sessions excluded from all admin list views going forward
- **`general_notice` param mismatch** — template edited in Meta from 2 params `[name, message]` to 1 param `[{{month}}]`; updated `reminder_sender.py` TEMPLATE_PARAM_NAMES, `scheduler.py` send logic, `reminder_router.py` BulkNoticeRequest — would have caused silent 400 from Meta on May 3rd fire

### Changed
- **Reminder schedule** — `general_notice` (overdue nudge) now fires on 1st, 3rd, 5th of each month (was only 2nd)

---

## [1.74.31] — 2026-05-02 — Scheduler fixes: reminders, rollover, RS rows, CC

### Root causes fixed
- **May RS rows not created (236 missing)** — two stacked bugs: (1) `_monthly_tab_rollover` in scheduler called `run_monthly_rollover.py` without `--skip-source`, causing step 1 (`sync_from_source_sheet.py --write`) to hit the April payments freeze trigger and abort. (2) `_generate_rs()` called `await init_engine()` — wrong: requires URL + not async. Fixed both. Ran manual rollover on VPS: 236 rows created.
- **Zero rent reminders sent on May 1** — `_rent_reminder` SQL query referenced `rs.is_void`, `rs.due_amount` — columns that don't exist on `rent_schedule` (actual columns: `status`, `rent_due`). `asyncpg.UndefinedColumnError` at 09:00 IST → 0 tenants notified. Fixed all three affected jobs.

### Fixed
- **`src/scheduler.py` — `_rent_reminder`** — replaced `rs.due_amount`/`rs.is_void`/`rs.paid_amount` with `rs.rent_due`/`rs.adjustment`/`rs.status` and payments JOIN.
- **`src/scheduler.py` — `_daily_reconciliation`** — same wrong column names; crashed at 02:00 IST every day since May 1. Fixed.
- **`src/scheduler.py` — `_checkout_deposit_alerts`** — `outstanding_dues` subquery used same wrong columns. Fixed with correlated payments subquery.
- **`scripts/run_monthly_rollover.py`** — `_generate_rs()` now calls `await init_db(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"])` correctly.
- **`src/scheduler.py` — rollover subprocess** — added `"--skip-source"` so scheduler never runs frozen source sync.
- **`tests/services/test_payments_service.py`** — all 10 tests changed from `period_month="2026-04"` (frozen) to `"2026-05"`.

### Changed
- **Reminder CC** — post-send summary now goes to all `admin`/`owner` phones from `authorized_users` (was only `_ADMIN_PHONE`). Lakshmi + business number now get notified when reminders go out.
- **Reminder schedule** — overdue nudges now fire on days 1, 3, 5 of each month (was only day 2). Removed stale `if today.day != 2: return` guard from `overdue_daily` mode.

---

## [1.74.30] — 2026-04-29 — Placeholder room renamed UNASSIGNED → 000

### Changed
- **DB room id=421** — `room_number` renamed `UNASSIGNED` → `000`; `max_occ` set to 50. Onboard tenants without a confirmed room by assigning room `000`; reassign later via Edit Tenant.
- **All exclusion filters updated** — `kpi.py` (9 sites), `notices.py`, `checkouts.py`, `excel_import.py`, `sync_sheet_from_db.py`, `sync_from_source_sheet.py`. Room 000 excluded from occupancy, bed counts, and all reports.

---

## [1.74.29] — 2026-04-29 — Investigation: notices count vs vacating count

### No code changes
- Clarified "on notice (16) vs vacating (24)" discrepancy. **On notice** = `notice_date IS NOT NULL` (formal notice given). **Vacating** = `expected_checkout` set in a given month (broader — includes tenants with scheduled checkout but no formal notice). Both are correct; they measure different things. `/notices/active` and KPI `notices_count` were already in sync (fix was in `fa14523`).

---

## [1.74.28] — 2026-04-29 — Checkouts list page + home quick links + notices cleanup

### Added
- **`src/api/v2/checkouts.py`** — new `GET /api/v2/app/checkouts?month=YYYY-MM`. Returns all exited tenants (monthly + day-wise) for the given month with refund amounts from checkout_records.
- **`web/app/checkouts/page.tsx`** — `/checkouts` page: month picker, name/room search, All/Regular/Day-wise filter tabs, summary row (count + total refunded), per-tenant cards.
- **`web/app/page.tsx`** — quick links row below KPI grid: Checkouts · Notices · Sessions always-visible shortcuts.
- **`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`** — "View all checkouts this month →" link inside expanded checkouts_today tile.

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/notices.py`** — removed "Expected Checkout — No Notice" query and section entirely. Notices page shows only monthly tenants with formal notice_date. Daily-stay tenants excluded.
- **`web/app/notices/page.tsx`** — Edit Notice modal now edits `expected_checkout` (Last Day), not `notice_date`. Notice-given date shown as read-only hint.
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — PATCH proration honours `prorate_this_month` flag: `false` = full month RS, `true` = prorated RS, absent = legacy behaviour (auto-prorate on room change).
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`** — Full/Prorated toggle shows when rent or room changes; confirm card reflects actual choice.

### Data fix
- Maharajan (tenancy 1030, room 219) — DB status set to `exited`; DAY WISE sheet resynced (36 exits shown).

---

## [1.74.25] — 2026-04-29 — Notices page: correct dates, consistent counts, May sheet created

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/notices.py`** — `expected_checkout` now uses `tenancy.expected_checkout` from DB (source of truth) instead of recalculating from `notice_date` via `calc_notice_last_day()`. Eliminates mismatch between Notices page dates and home KPI tile dates. Scoped to monthly tenants only.
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — `notices_count` and KPI detail list both updated to match: monthly tenants with formal `notice_date` only. Previously count included `expected_checkout`-only tenants while detail list did not — causing badge count vs list count mismatch.
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `NoticeItem.notice_date` typed as `string | null`; added `has_notice: boolean`.

### Ops
- **May 2026 sheet created** — `create_month.py MAY 2026` + `sync_sheet_from_db.py --write --month 5 --year 2026` run manually. 239 active, 17 no-show, Prev Due Rs.4,07,266 (sheet) / Rs.3,66,566 (DB — gap due to create_month not reading April balances; re-sync on May 1).
- **April dues breakdown run** — 41 tenants owe Rs.3,66,566. 5 UNASSIGNED-room tenants owe Rs.69,000 — need investigation.

---

## [1.74.24] — 2026-04-29 — Tenant edit: room change + proration toggle + TENANTS tab sync

### Added
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`** — Room field at top of edit form; live occupancy check on blur. Hard blocks if new room is full.
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`** — Full / Prorated toggle for mid-month rent or room changes. Auto-calculates `floor(rent * remaining_days / days_in_month)`. Passed as `prorate_this_month` to backend. Shows only when rent or room changes.
- **`web/components/forms/confirmation-card.tsx`** — `error?: string` prop; red banner inside card so API errors are visible without closing it.
- **`src/integrations/gsheets.py`** — `sync_tenants_tab_field()`: generic TENANTS master tab single-field updater (finds column by header name).

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** PATCH: room reassignment with occupancy check (409 if full); `prorate_this_month` upserts current month `RentSchedule.rent_due`; mirrors `agreed_rent` / `maintenance_fee` / `security_deposit` / `notes` to TENANTS master tab after commit.
- **`src/database/models.py` + migrate_all.py** — `audit_log.changed_by` and `rent_revisions.changed_by` widened to `VARCHAR(100)` (Supabase UUIDs are 36 chars). Root cause of "Failed to fetch" on rent saves.
- **Bot notes** — `UPDATE_TENANT_NOTES` and combined payment+notes flow now call `trigger_monthly_sheet_sync` (full rebuild) instead of a targeted cell write that was failing silently.
- **Transfer Room panel removed** from edit page — confusing when non-room fields changed. Room field + PATCH endpoint handles it.
- **Error visibility** — `setShowConfirm(false)` removed from catch blocks; errors stay visible inside ConfirmationCard.
- **Back-nav headers** on all 5 success screens (checkin, checkout, payment, edit-tenant, onboarding).

---

## [1.74.23] — 2026-04-29 — Fix: voice onboarding service-not-allowed error

### Fixed
- **`web/components/voice/onboarding-voice-sheet.tsx`** — Chrome throws `service-not-allowed` when `SpeechRecognition.start()` is called from a `useEffect` (not a direct user gesture). Removed auto-start useEffect; added `"idle"` initial state with `IdleView` (tap-to-start mic button). `speech.start()` is now always called from a click handler. Also removed unused `useRef` import.

---

## [1.74.22] — 2026-04-29 — Feat: voice onboarding (speak tenant details → form pre-fills)

### Added
- **`web/components/voice/onboarding-voice-sheet.tsx`** — New bottom sheet for voice onboarding. Multi-turn: receptionist can speak multiple rounds; bot accumulates fields across rounds. States: idle → recording → extracting → speaking → confirm → error. "Fill Form" button disabled until room, phone, and rent are all captured.
- **`web/lib/parse-onboarding.ts`** — `parseOnboardingFields(transcript, existing)`: calls `/api/voice/extract` (Groq proxy), merges result over `emptyOnboardingFields()` to prevent undefined keys, safe JSON.parse with try-catch.
- **`web/lib/tts.ts`** — `speakText(text)`: calls `/api/voice/speak` (OpenAI proxy), falls back to browser `speechSynthesis` on failure.
- **`web/app/api/voice/extract/route.ts`** — Server-side proxy to Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. Reads `GROQ_API_KEY` (no NEXT_PUBLIC_).
- **`web/app/api/voice/speak/route.ts`** — Server-side proxy to OpenAI TTS (`tts-1`, voice `nova`). Returns `audio/mpeg`. Reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` (no NEXT_PUBLIC_).

### Edited
- **`web/app/onboarding/new/page.tsx`** — Pink mic button in header opens `OnboardingVoiceSheet`. `handleVoiceConfirm(fields)` maps all 12 `OnboardingFields` → form state setters. `advance_mode` validated against `Set(["cash","upi","bank"])` before setting.
- **`web/.env.local.example`** — Added `GROQ_API_KEY=` and `OPENAI_API_KEY=`.

### Security
- API keys are server-side only (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix). OpenAI paid key never reaches the browser bundle.

### Cost
- Groq `llama-3.3-70b`: free. OpenAI TTS: ~₹25/month at 15 onboardings/month.

---

## [1.74.21] — 2026-04-29 — Notices page: search filter + edit notice date modal

### Added
- **`web/app/notices/page.tsx`** — Search bar filters by name, room, or phone in real time; list sorted by days_remaining ascending
- **`web/app/notices/page.tsx`** — "Edit notice" button on every card opens a modal: change notice date (shifts eligible/forfeited classification) or remove notice entirely; uses existing `PATCH /tenants/{id}` endpoint via `patchTenant`

---

## [1.74.20] — 2026-04-29 — Feat: room transfer shared service (bot + PWA backend unified)

### Added
- **`services/room_transfer.py`** — new shared `execute_room_transfer()` service. Single source of truth for all room transfers — used by both WhatsApp bot and PWA API. Handles: room lookup, staff room guard, occupancy check via `get_room_occupants()`, DB writes (room_id, agreed_rent, RentRevision, RentSchedule, security_deposit +=, AuditLog), fire-and-forget sheet sync.
- **`src/api/v2/rooms.py`** — new `GET /api/v2/app/rooms/check?room=XXX`. Returns room availability (free beds, occupants list).
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — new `POST /api/v2/app/tenants/{id}/transfer-room`. Body: `{to_room_number, new_rent, extra_deposit}`. Delegates to shared service, commits on success.
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `checkRoom()` and `transferRoom()` client functions + `RoomCheckResult`, `TransferRoomBody`, `TransferRoomResult` types.

### Refactored
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`** — `_do_room_transfer` delegates to `execute_room_transfer()`. Removed 65 lines of inline DB logic. `final_confirm` step simplified (duplicate RentSchedule + deposit code removed — service handles it).

### Architecture
Bot `ROOM_TRANSFER` multi-step flow unchanged. Only the final DB-write step is shared. Both callers guaranteed identical behavior — no drift.

### Note
PWA 4-step Transfer Room panel was added then removed in same session (commit `3d49a26`). Room changes in the edit form go through the existing room_number field + PATCH endpoint (occupancy check + proration auto-applied). A dedicated guided panel remains a future option if needed.

---

## [1.74.19] — 2026-04-29 — Rule: no hardcoded sheet columns project-wide + DAY WISE numeric format fix

### Fixed
- **`scripts/sync_daywise_from_db.py`** — After `ws.clear()` + bulk write, now re-applies `NUMBER` format to all numeric columns (Rent/Day → Balance, F:O). `ws.clear()` wipes cell formats; without this, Sheets displays numeric values as date serials.
- **DAY WISE tab (live sheet)** — Applied `NUMBER` format to `F3:O200` immediately; clears existing date-bleed in Rent/Day column (rows 21, 36, 38 showed date values like "1899-12-30" instead of numbers).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Added "Sheet column rule (CRITICAL)" section: no `r[14]`, no `chr(65 + magic_number)`, always `HEADERS` + `C` dict + `col_letter()` helper. Required for all new and edited files.
- **`memory/feedback_sheet_column_references.md`** — Expanded scope to all project files, added format-after-clear requirement, added 2026-04-29 incident as motivation.

### Audit findings
- `gsheets.py` monthly/TENANTS writes: already semantic via `M_*`/`T_*` constants derived from `_derive_constants()` — clean.
- `sync_daywise_from_db.py`: already semantic (HEADERS + C dict) — only missing the post-write format call, now fixed.
- `_add_daywise_stay_sync`: rewritten to semantic dict mapping last session (v1.74.15) — clean.
- Legacy one-off scripts (`april_balance_29.py`, `mirror_march_source_to_ops.py`): contain hardcoded positional reads but are historical/frozen data scripts — not touched.

---

## [1.74.18] — 2026-04-29 — Feat: prorate this-month rent_due on mid-month room transfers

### Fixed / Added
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — `PATCH /tenants/{id}`: when `room_number` changes, recalculates current-month `RentSchedule.rent_due` with proration. First-month tenants (checkin in current month) prorate from checkin day; all others prorate remaining days from today.
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`** — Bot `ROOM_TRANSFER` flow: `current_rent` now reads `tenancy.agreed_rent` (not `rs.rent_due`, which was inflated by the first-month deposit bundle). `checkin_date` stored in `action_data`. Confirmation message shows read-only prorated line: `Apr prorated (this month): Rs.X,XXX (Y/30 days × Rs.rent)`. `final_confirm` always writes prorated amount to RS.
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`** — Read-only green tile shows prorated amount when room changes; same value echoed in ConfirmationCard. Non-editable.

### Data fix
- **Prasanth.P (tenancy 920, room G15)** — `RentSchedule.rent_due` corrected `26,000 → 15,600` (2,600 prorated for 6 days Apr 25–30 + 13,000 deposit). April sheet resynced (283 rows).

## [1.74.17] — 2026-04-29 — Fix: bot RECORD_CHECKOUT missing DAY WISE sheet sync for daily stays

### Fixed
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`** — Bot `RECORD_CHECKOUT` confirm step called `gsheets_checkout` but never called `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync()` for daily tenants — only the PWA path (`_do_confirm_checkout`) had this. Root cause of Chandrasekhar Rathod staying as ACTIVE in DAY WISE sheet after bot checkout.

### Data fix
- Ran `sync_daywise_from_db.py --write` manually to push correct EXITED status for Chandrasekhar Rathod (tenancy 1056, room G15, checkout 2026-04-29).

---

## [1.74.16] — 2026-04-29 — Fix: DAY WISE tab not synced on any day-wise tenant mutation

### Fixed
- **`src/integrations/gsheets.py`** — Added `_record_daywise_checkout_sync(room, name, exit_date)`: finds tenant row in DAY WISE tab by room+name fuzzy match, sets Status=EXITED and Checkout date using dynamic header map. `_record_checkout_sync` now falls back to this function when monthly tab lookup fails (day-wise tenants have no monthly row).
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`** — `_do_confirm_checkout` now calls `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync()` for `stay_type=daily` instead of `trigger_monthly_sheet_sync`. 
- **`src/api/v2/checkin.py`** — `record_physical_checkin` calls `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync()` for daily stays instead of monthly sync.
- **`src/api/v2/payments.py`** — `POST /payments` calls `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync()` for daily stays instead of monthly sync.
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — `PATCH /tenants/{id}` (rent change, room change, deposit, notes) calls `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync()` for daily stays; skips `record_notice` for day-wise (no Notice Date column in DAY WISE tab).

### Data fix
- Chandrashekar Rathod (Room G15) — DAY WISE tab row manually updated to Status=EXITED, Checkout=29/04/2026 after force-confirm via script.

### Root cause
Day-wise tenants live exclusively in the DAY WISE sheet tab. All previous sheet write operations used `_find_tenant_tab()` which searches only monthly tabs (April 2026, March 2026, etc.) — returning "Row not found" for every day-wise mutation. Now all mutations dispatch to the correct tab based on `stay_type`.

---

## [1.74.15] — 2026-04-29 — Fix: DAY WISE tab column shift from onboarding form

### Fixed
- **`src/integrations/gsheets.py`** — `_add_daywise_stay_sync` now uses header-based dict mapping (semantic) against new `DAY_WISE_HEADERS` constant instead of a hardcoded positional array. Previous `_build_daywise_row` wrote `booking_amount` to the "Days" column and shifted all subsequent columns.
- Defined `DAY_WISE_HEADERS = [Room, Name, Phone, Building, Sharing, Rent/Day, Days, Booking Amt, Security Dep, Maintenance, Rent Due, Cash, UPI, Total Paid, Balance, Status, Check-in, Checkout, Entered By]` — matches existing tab structure.
- Sheet header row 1 corrected from MONTHLY_HEADERS to DAY_WISE_HEADERS.
- Two bad rows (Yogesh/Rutika room 210, sarathbabu room 407) fixed in-place: cleared stale data and re-written with correct column positions.

---

## [1.74.14] — 2026-04-29 — Fix: tenant search — numeric query matches exact room only

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — `GET /tenants/search`: when query is all digits (e.g. "420"), now matches `room_number` exactly only. Previously `LIKE '%420%'` on phone/name returned unrelated tenants whose phone numbers contained "420". Non-numeric queries (names, partial phones) still use contains match on all three fields.

---

## [1.74.13-data] — 2026-04-29 — Data fix: Prasanth.P (G15) sharing_type + April rent_due

### Fixed (data only, no code deploy)
- **`tenancies` id=920 (Prasanth.P, G15)** — `sharing_type` corrected from `triple` → `double` (room G15 is a double room; room reassignment had not auto-updated the field)
- **`rent_schedule` id=11630 (Prasanth.P, April 2026)** — `rent_due` updated from ₹13,000 → ₹26,000 (first-month rule: rent ₹13,000 + deposit ₹13,000); `adjustment_note = MANUAL_LOCK` cleared
- April sheet re-synced; Total Dues updated ₹89,166 → ₹1,02,166 (+₹13,000 deposit now in dues)
- TENANTS master tab updated via `sync_tenant_all_fields`

---

## [1.74.13] — 2026-04-29 — Checkout: remove tenant approval, immediate confirm

### Changed
- **`src/api/v2/checkout.py`** — `POST /checkout/create` now confirms immediately (no pending session, no WhatsApp template to tenant). `_do_confirm_checkout` called inline; returns `{"status": "confirmed"}`.
- **`src/api/checkout_router.py`** — Same change for the old HTML admin form route.
- **`src/scheduler.py`** — Removed `checkout_auto_confirm` job + `_auto_confirm_checkout_sessions` function (no longer needed).
- **`src/whatsapp/chat_api.py`** — Removed YES/NO intercept block; removed `CheckoutSession/CheckoutSessionStatus` imports.
- **`src/whatsapp/gatekeeper.py`** — Removed `CHECKOUT_AGREE` / `CHECKOUT_REJECT` routing.
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`** — Removed `_handle_checkout_agree` + `_handle_checkout_reject`. `_do_confirm_checkout` now sends a one-way WhatsApp notification to the tenant (not asking for approval).
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`** — Removed polling logic (`getCheckoutStatus`, `pollStatus`, `useCallback`). Success screen updated to "Checkout Done! · Tenant notified via WhatsApp".

### Added
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — `checkouts_today` tile now includes `status` + `is_checked_out` flag per item.
- **`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`** — Already-checked-out tenants show greyed "Checked out" badge instead of active "Check-out →" button.
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `is_checked_out?: boolean` in `KpiDetailItem`.
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — Room reassignment syncs `tenancy.sharing_type` to match new room's `room_type`.
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`** — When navigated from KPI tile (`?tenancy_id=`), shows locked tenant banner (name + room + "Change" button) instead of the search box. `pollStatus` state restored (was stripped by linter).

---

## [1.74.12] — 2026-04-29 — Back-nav header on all PWA success screens

### Added
- **`web/app/checkin/new/page.tsx`** — Fixed top header ("Check-in Recorded" + ← Home) on success screen
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`** — Fixed top header ("Checkout Initiated" + ← Home) on success screen
- **`web/app/payment/new/page.tsx`** — Fixed top header ("Payment Saved" + ← Home) on success screen
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`** — Fixed top header ("Changes Saved" + ← Back to Manage) on success screen
- **`web/app/onboarding/new/page.tsx`** — Fixed top header ("Session Created" + ← Home) on success screen

All success screens were previously missing back-navigation. The fixed bottom nav bar was also hiding action buttons (← Home / + New) when content was vertically centred. Fixed by removing `justify-center` and adding `pt-16 pb-32` for scrollable top-aligned layout.

---

## [1.74.12] — 2026-04-28 — Root cause fix: recurring Cash inflation in Sheet

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/payments.py`** — `gsheets_update()` now only fires for `for_type == "rent"`. Previously fired for all non-booking payments (including deposits, maintenance), causing an immediate ADD-increment to the Cash column on every deposit logged via PWA. Background full sync corrected it seconds later, but if sync was slow or failed, the inflation stuck.
- **Root cause of "daily 16L" identified:** v1.74.0 backfilled ₹3,18,750 of deposit payments into Sheet Cash cells. Then every `trigger_monthly_sheet_sync` using the old sync script re-added `deposit_credit` to Cash → 16L. Manual fixes brought it to 13L, but the next payment triggered another sync → 16L again.
- **Both vectors now sealed:** (1) `sync_sheet_from_db.py` no longer adds `deposit_credit` to Cash/Total Paid columns; (2) `gsheets_update()` skips all non-rent payments.
- **April 2026 confirmed stable:** Cash Rs.13,05,783 / UPI Rs.31,54,345 / Dues Rs.88,766 — resynced and verified.

---

## [1.74.11] — 2026-04-28 — Day-wise: check-in/out time entry + nights billing

### Added
- **`src/database/models.py`** — `checkin_time` (Time, nullable) + `checkout_time` (Time, nullable) on `Tenancy`
- **`src/database/migrate_all.py`** — `run_add_daywise_time_fields_2026_04_28` migration
- **`src/api/v2/checkin.py`** — `actual_checkin_time` (HH:MM) in `CheckinRequest`; stored in `tenancy.checkin_time` for daily stays
- **`src/api/v2/checkout.py`** — prefetch returns `stay_type`, `daily_rate`, `booked_checkout_date`, `checkin_time`; `CheckoutCreateBody` accepts `checkout_time`; stored in `tenancy.checkout_time` for daily stays
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `actual_checkin_time` in `CheckinCreate`; `stay_type`, `daily_rate`, `booked_checkout_date`, `checkin_time` in `CheckoutPrefetch`; `checkout_time` in `CheckoutCreateBody`
- **`web/app/checkin/new/page.tsx`** — time input for day-wise stays (defaults to current time); "Days" → "Nights" label throughout
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`** — checkout time input for day-wise stays; Stay Summary card (check-in time, booked checkout, checkout time, daily rate); extra nights auto-detected when actual checkout > booked date — extra charge added to dues + orange warning banner

---

## [1.74.10] — 2026-04-28 — Guardrails, sessions UX, sheet sync corrections

### Added
- **`web/app/onboarding/sessions/page.tsx`** — Full rewrite for `pending_review` sessions:
  - `EditableField` component: renders `<input>` for editable fields, `DetailField` for read-only
  - Day-wise sessions: shows `checkout_date`, `num_days` (auto-computed), `daily_rate`
  - `pending_review` state: all financial fields (rent, deposit, maintenance, prorated, daily_rate, num_days, checkout_date) + name/phone/gender editable
  - Gender: `<select>` dropdown (Male/Female/Other); blue hint banner "Fields are editable — changes apply on Approve"
  - `handleApprove` passes changed fields in `overrides` dict to backend
- **`web/app/onboarding/new/page.tsx`** — Room occupancy check on room-number blur:
  - Fetches `/api/onboarding/room-lookup/{room}` (extended to return occupancy)
  - Red warning box if `is_full` (shows occupant names); green "X/Y beds occupied" when space available
- **`web/app/checkin/new/page.tsx`** — Already-checked-in guard:
  - Red warning banner when `preview.already_checked_in`
  - CTA disabled + label "Already Checked In — Use Payment Form"
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `CheckinPreview` extended: `tenancy_status`, `already_checked_in`

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/checkin.py`** — Checkin POST now accepts `no_show` tenants (was 404 for all monthly tenants with future check-in date); adds `no_show → active` status transition on physical check-in. Preview endpoint returns `already_checked_in` flag (monthly, active, checkin_date ≥ 3 days ago).
- **`src/api/onboarding_router.py`** — `room_lookup` endpoint extended to return `occupied`, `max_occupancy`, `is_full`, `occupants[]`; `admin/{token}/detail` returns `checkout_date`, `num_days`, `daily_rate`, `future_rent`, `future_rent_after_months`
- **`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`** — Removed `deposit_credit` from `cash` and `total_paid` sheet display columns (was inflating cash by ₹3,14,350 in April)
- **Voided payment ID 14636** — Ronak Samriya ₹18,000 UPI 2026-04-27 (test/mistake payment; he had already paid ₹15,000 via source sync)
- **April 2026 sheet resynced** — 283 rows written with corrected numbers: Cash Rs.13,05,783, UPI Rs.31,54,345, Collected Rs.44,60,128, Dues Rs.88,766

---

## [1.74.9] — 2026-04-28 — Collection dashboard redesign: clean obligation view

### Changed
- **`src/services/reporting.py`** — `collection_summary()` fully redesigned:
  - `collected = max(0, expected - pending)` — now shows how much of the rent obligation is settled; never exceeds `expected`
  - `pure_rent_expected` uses `Tenancy.agreed_rent + RentSchedule.adjustment` (not `rent_due`) — deposits never baked into expected
  - `method_breakdown` reverted to **period-scoped** — shows Cash vs UPI for this billing period's rent only; matches `rent_collected`; excludes prior-due catch-ups and future advances
  - Added `prior_dues_collected`, `cash_received_for_current_period`, `future_advances_collected`, `deposits_received`, `booking_advances` fields
- **`src/schemas/reporting.py`** — `CollectionSummaryResponse` extended with all new fields
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `CollectionSummary` interface updated to match backend schema
- **`web/components/home/overview-card.tsx`** — label changed to "Rent settled this month"; uses `collected = expected − pending`
- **`web/app/collection/breakdown/page.tsx`** — full redesign:
  - Removed confusing "All cash received" section (rent row exceeded expected, was misleading)
  - Sections: Summary → Rent this month → How it was paid (Cash/UPI, period-scoped) → Pending → Security deposits held
- **`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`** — removed `deposit_credit` from `cash` and `total_paid` sheet columns (deposit credits are period-scoped; adding to date-scoped cash inflated the cash column)

### Fixed
- `maintenance_due` in `RentSchedule` rows zeroed (was copying `maintenance_fee` from tenancy; maintenance is a one-time deposit component, not a monthly obligation)
- 5 code sites (`payments.py`, `checkin.py`, `onboarding_router.py`, `owner_handler.py`, `reminder_router.py`) that were setting `maintenance_due = maintenance_fee` — all fixed to `Decimal("0")`

---

## [1.74.8] — 2026-04-28 — Reminder fixes + automated rent reminder schedule

### Fixed
- **`src/api/v2/reminders.py`** — `rent_reminder` template only has `{{name}}` (1 param); was sending 3 params → Meta returned 400 → Reminder never saved → count reset to 0 on refresh. Fixed `body_params=[r.name]`.
- **`web/app/reminders/page.tsx`** — frontend was optimistically incrementing `reminder_count` on any HTTP 200, regardless of whether the send succeeded. Now checks `res.sent.includes(tenancyId)` before incrementing.
- **`src/whatsapp/reminder_sender.py`** — updated template catalog comment to match actual approved template body (1 param, no amount/month).

### Added
- **`src/scheduler.py`** — enabled 2-tier automated rent reminders:
  - **Day -1** (last day of month, 9am IST): `rent_reminder` template to all active tenants
  - **Day +2** (2nd of month, 9am IST): `general_notice` to unpaid tenants with overdue amount + ₹200/day late-fee warning from 6th
  - Fixed 3-params bug in scheduler's `_rent_reminder` too (same as PWA fix)
  - Removed day+1 reminder per Kiran's instruction

---

## [1.74.7] — 2026-04-28 — Notice management: KPI tile + tenant edit + bot withdrawal

### Added
- **`src/schemas/kpi.py`** — `notices_count: int` field in `KpiResponse`
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — notices_count query (active tenants with notice_date); `kpi-detail?type=notices` branch returning `deposit_eligible` per tenant
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — dues GET now returns `notice_date` + `expected_checkout`; PATCH now accepts both fields and triggers `record_notice` sheet sync
- **`src/api/v2/checkout.py`** — prefetch response now includes `expected_checkout`
- **`src/integrations/gsheets.py`** — `record_notice` accepts `None` for notice_date/expected_exit (passes empty string to sync, clears cells)
- **`src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py`** — `NOTICE_WITHDRAWN` pattern (cancel/withdraw/revoke/take-back notice; "not leaving", "changed mind leaving") at 0.93 confidence, placed before `NOTICE_GIVEN` in both strict and fallback sections
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`** — `_withdraw_notice` handler + inline resolver; searches active tenants with notice_date, shows notice + exit date, yes → clears DB fields + calls `record_notice("", "")`; added to handler map + cancel-with-no list
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `notices_count` in `KpiResponse`; `deposit_eligible` in `KpiDetailItem`; `notice_date` + `expected_checkout` in `TenantDues`; `notice_date?` + `expected_checkout?` in `PatchTenantBody`; `expected_checkout` in `CheckoutPrefetch`
- **`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`** — "On notice" KPI tile (col-span-2, orange, only when notices_count > 0); name filter bar; deposit eligibility badge (Refundable green / Forfeited red) per row; `"notices"` added to `TileKey`
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`** — Notice card: notice date input, deposit badge (computed from day ≤ 5), expected checkout input, "Withdraw notice" button (clears both fields); change detection compares against originals
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`** — auto-fills `checkoutDate` from `expected_checkout` on prefetch load; notice banner shows refund amount when deposit eligible

### Fixed
- `PatchTenantBody.expected_checkout` typed as `string | null` (was `string`) — fixed TypeScript build error

---

## [1.74.6] — 2026-04-28 — Notices page + checkout forfeiture logic

### Added
- **`src/api/v2/notices.py`** — new `GET /api/v2/app/notices/active` endpoint: returns all active tenants with `notice_date IS NOT NULL`, sorted by expected checkout date. Applies `NOTICE_BY_DAY = 5` rule from `services/property_logic.py` (`calc_notice_last_day`, `is_deposit_eligible`). Returns `deposit_eligible`, `expected_checkout`, `days_remaining` per tenant.
- **`web/app/notices/page.tsx`** — new Notices page at `/notices`. Lists tenants in two sections: Deposit Eligible (green badge, notice on/before 5th) and Deposit Forfeited (orange badge, after 5th). Each card shows notice date, expected last day, est. refund, "Process Checkout →" CTA. Count badge + refresh button in header.
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `NoticeItem` interface + `getActiveNotices()` function.

### Changed
- **`src/api/v2/app_router.py`** — registered `notices_router`
- **`web/app/tenants/page.tsx`** — added "Notices" quick action tile (orange, warning triangle icon) in the grid at `/tenants`
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`** — notice status banner shown after tenant selected:
  - Green: "Notice on DD Mon YYYY (on time) — deposit eligible" + expected last day
  - Orange: "Notice on DD Mon YYYY (after 5th) — deposit forfeited" + last day + extra month charged
  - Orange: "No notice on record — deposit forfeited"
  - When forfeited: refund auto-sets to ₹0, deductions numpad hidden, "Override" button opens numpad for anomaly refunds (zero refund or more than standard)
  - Refund mode selector shown only when refund amount > 0

---

## [1.74.5] — 2026-04-28 — Edit tenant: maintenance fee + lock-in + pre-filled notes

### Changes
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — dues endpoint now returns `maintenance_fee`, `lock_in_months`, `notes`; PATCH endpoint accepts `maintenance_fee` and `lock_in_months`
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — `TenantDues` + `PatchTenantBody` updated with new fields
- **`web/app/tenants/[tenancy_id]/edit/page.tsx`** — Maintenance Fee field added to Financials section; Lock-in Months field added to Stay Details; Notes pre-filled from existing value (edit-in-place, not append); change detection: only sends if value differs from original

---

## [1.74.4] — 2026-04-28 — Planned rent increase — end-to-end

### Feature: Planned rent increase at onboarding

Set an intro rent + a future rent in one onboarding session. No manual follow-up needed.

**Data model**
- `onboarding_sessions.future_rent NUMERIC(12,2)` — nullable
- `onboarding_sessions.future_rent_after_months INTEGER` — nullable
- Migration: `run_add_planned_rent_increase_2026_04_28` (append-only)

**Formula** — `effective_date = 1st of (checkin_month + N)`
- Current month always counts as month 1 (never skipped)
- Example: checkin Apr 28, N=2 → intro months April & May → new rate from June 1

**Backend** (`src/api/onboarding_router.py`)
- `POST /api/onboarding/create` — accepts `future_rent`, `future_rent_after_months`
- `GET /api/onboarding/{token}` — returns both fields to tenant form
- `POST /api/onboarding/{token}/approve` — monthly path: if `future_rent` set, pre-inserts `rent_revision` row (old_rent=agreed_rent, new_rent=future_rent, effective_date, reason="planned_rent_increase"). Monthly rollover will apply it automatically.
- WhatsApp at create-time: fallback message appended with `→ Rs.X/mo from [Month]`
- WhatsApp at approval: fallback confirmation note added if rent increase scheduled

**Tenant form** (`static/onboarding.html`)
- Room summary card: "Monthly Rent: ₹11,500 → ₹13,000/mo from June"
- Agreement booking summary: same note

**PWA** (`web/app/onboarding/new/page.tsx`)
- "Planned Rent Increase" section: solid border (no Preview badge), wired to API
- Preview shows actual month names: "April & May, then ₹13,000/mo from June"
- `future_rent=0` skips the field entirely (no revision inserted)

---

## [1.74.3] — 2026-04-28 — PWA onboarding sessions page + quick actions

### New: Onboarding sessions page (`/onboarding/sessions`)
- Lists all sessions with status filter tabs (All, Pending Review, Awaiting Tenant, Approved, Cancelled, Expired)
- Expandable session cards with room, financials, tenant info, approve/cancel/copy-link/resend actions
- Uses PIN auth (same `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONBOARDING_PIN`)
- Quick Action tile "Onboarding Sessions" added to `/tenants` page

---

## [1.74.2] — 2026-04-28 — PWA nav on all pages + sticky CTA fix

### Changes
- **`web/components/home/nav-wrapper.tsx`** — nav bar now shows on ALL pages (removed path exclusions for onboarding, payment, checkin, checkout, reminders, tenants detail). Only `/login` still hides it.
- **`web/app/checkin/new/page.tsx`**, **`checkout/new/page.tsx`**, **`onboarding/new/page.tsx`**, **`payment/new/page.tsx`** — sticky CTA padding raised from `pb-8` (32px) to `pb-28` (112px) so "Review & Confirm" buttons always appear above the ~84px floating nav pill.
- **`web/components/home/home-tab-bar.tsx`** — `/checkout` path now highlights the Manage tab.

---

## [1.74.1] — 2026-04-28 — PWA checkout form + checkin/onboarding UX fixes

### New: Physical check-out form (`/checkout/new`)
- **`src/api/v2/checkout.py`** — JWT-protected checkout endpoints: `GET /checkout/tenant/{id}` (prefetch with maintenance_fee separate), `POST /checkout/create`, `GET /checkout/status/{token}`
- **`src/api/v2/app_router.py`** — registered checkout router
- **`web/app/checkout/new/page.tsx`** — full checkout form: tenant search, date picker, 4-item handover checklist, deductions numpad, refund calc (`deposit − maintenance_fee − pending_dues − deductions`), refund mode selector, ConfirmationCard, success screen with 5s status polling
- **`web/app/tenants/page.tsx`** — added "New Check-out" Quick Action tile (orange)
- **`web/components/home/nav-wrapper.tsx`** — `/checkout/` added to nav-hide list

### Fix: Checkout refund formula
- `maintenance_fee` is always deducted at checkout (even when all dues paid). API returns it separately from `pending_dues`.

### Fix: Check-in payment method selector
- Method selector now only shows when `amount > 0` (was always visible, pushing under sticky CTA on mobile).

### Fix: Onboarding form — advance payment method
- Added `advanceMode` state + Cash/UPI/Bank toggle shown when `booking > 0`. Sends `advance_mode` field to API (was causing HTTP 400 on submissions with booking amount).

---

## [1.74.0] — 2026-04-28 — April dues fixed (Rs.4L → Rs.88,766) — three-layer bug

### Root cause
Three compounding bugs caused April Total Dues to show Rs.4,04,266 instead of the correct Rs.88,766:

1. **gsheets write-back crashed for deposit/booking payments** — `period_month=None` caused `datetime.strptime` to raise `TypeError`. Deposit Cash was never written to Sheet.
2. **`sync_sheet_from_db.py` April balance excluded `deposit_credit`** — First-month rent_due already bundles the deposit (`prorated + deposit - booking`). Without subtracting `deposit_credit` from balance, tenants who paid deposit showed as fully unpaid.
3. **`_refresh_summary_sync` overwrote COLLECTION row after every payment** — Computed Total Dues as per-row clamped `sum(max(0, balance))` which overstates (Rs.1,45,016) because overpaying tenants don't cancel underpaying ones in per-row view.

### Fixes

- **`src/api/v2/payments.py`**
  - Skip gsheets write-back when `for_type == "booking"` (booking amount already pre-subtracted from Rent Due via `first_month_rent_due`; writing it to Cash would double-count)
  - Use `payment_date.month/year` when `period_month is None` (deposits/bookings have no billing period)
  - Added `trigger_monthly_sheet_sync(period.month, period.year)` after every PWA payment to refresh COLLECTION row

- **`src/integrations/gsheets.py`** — `_refresh_summary_sync`
  - Removed ALL summary row writes (r2_occ, r3_bld, r4_col, r5_sts, r6_notice, ws.update block)
  - `_refresh_summary_sync` now ONLY updates per-row Balance/Status/TotalPaid cells
  - COLLECTION row (Total Dues, Cash, UPI, Collected) is EXCLUSIVELY owned by `sync_sheet_from_db`

- **`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`**
  - April balance formula now subtracts `deposit_credit`
  - Cash/TotalPaid columns include `deposit_credit` for first-month tenants
  - Total Dues now computed from `collection_summary().pending` (same DB aggregate as PWA/bot), NOT from per-row clamped sum

- **`scripts/backfill_april_deposits_to_sheet.py`** (one-time, already run)
  - Backfilled 23 April deposit payments (Rs.3,18,750) to Sheet Cash column that were never written due to the crash

### Rules established (see REPORTING.md §7)

- `_refresh_summary_sync` = per-row cells only. NEVER writes summary/COLLECTION rows.
- `sync_sheet_from_db` = sole owner of COLLECTION row.
- Total Dues = `collection_summary().pending` — aggregate DB formula. Never per-row sum.
- Booking payments: NEVER write to Sheet Cash/UPI.
- gsheets write-back: use `payment_date` when `period_month` is None.

## [1.73.10] — 2026-04-28 — Monthly tab Notes column uses original Excel comment

### Fix — Notes column no longer shows auto-generated cash/UPI/balance text
- **`scripts/clean_and_load.py`** — monthly tab Notes column now writes `t.get('comment', '')` (original Excel col 15 note) instead of `" | ".join(notes_parts)` which was concatenating text extracted from cash/UPI/balance cells. Chandra/Lakshmi tracking logic is unchanged.

---

## [1.73.9] — 2026-04-27 — KPI dues card + monthly rollover carry-forward

### Bug fix — dues card now shows 18 tenants / ₹88,766 (matching ops sheet)
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — KPI summary tile (overdue count + total) and dues expansion view both now use `effective_due = rent_due + adjustment` instead of bare `rent_due`. WHERE, ORDER BY, detail label, and `dues` field all updated.
- **`src/services/monthly_rollover.py`** — new `_prev_outstanding()` helper queries previous month's unpaid balance using the same payment formula (rent period-match + deposit/booking calendar-month match). `generate_rent_schedule_for_month()` now sets `adjustment = carry` and `adjustment_note = "Month YYYY carry-forward: ₹X,XXX"` on new rows for active tenants with outstanding balances.
- **Impact**: April 2026 dues card correctly shows all 18 unpaid tenants. May 2026 rollover will automatically carry forward any unpaid April dues into the `adjustment` column.

---

## [1.73.8] — 2026-04-27 — First-month dues inflated bug fix (28 tenants / ₹3.9L)

### Bug fix — deposit+booking payments now count toward dues calculation
- **Root cause**: `rent_schedule.rent_due` for first-month tenants bundles deposit (e.g. ₹22k rent + ₹22k deposit = ₹44k). But deposit/booking payments have `period_month=NULL` and `for_type=deposit/booking`, so the old `paid` query (filter: `for_type=rent AND period_month=Apr`) missed them entirely.
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — `paid_subq` now uses `OR`: rent payments for the period, OR deposit/booking payments with `period_month=NULL` and `payment_date` within the period month. Applied in both `/kpi` and `/kpi-detail?type=dues`.
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — same fix in `get_tenant_dues`; also picks up `rs.adjustment` field.
- **Impact**: 28 April check-ins affected; ₹3,90,000 in payments now correctly counted. Example: Arumugam Sathish (513) was showing ₹32,000 dues, now shows ₹5,000.

---

## [1.73.7] — 2026-04-27 — Dashboard dues fix + day-stay payment mode fix

### Bug fixes
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py`** — `show dashboard` dues line now shows current month (Apr 2026) outstanding instead of previous month (Mar 2026); removed unused `prev_month`/`prev_label` variables
- **`src/api/onboarding_router.py`** — day-stay onboarding payment no longer hardcodes CASH; now reads `obs.advance_mode` (UPI or CASH) same as monthly path
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — removed unused `DaywiseStay` import (leftover from earlier refactor)

---

## [1.73.6] — 2026-04-27 — Dues tile replaces complaints on PWA home

### PWA home screen
- **`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`** — replaced "Open complaints" tile with "Dues pending" tile showing total outstanding amount (Indian comma format) + overdue tenant count; expandable list has name/room search + THOR/HULK building filter pills; vacant list gender filter restored
- **`src/api/v2/kpi.py`** — `/kpi` now returns `overdue_amount` (sum of unpaid rent); `/kpi-detail?type=dues` returns per-tenant dues with building from Property join
- **`src/schemas/kpi.py`** — added `overdue_amount: float` to `KpiResponse`
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — added `overdue_amount`, `dues?`, `building?` fields to typed interfaces

---

## [1.73.5] — 2026-04-27 — Full amounts everywhere (no L/Cr abbreviation)

### Format fix — all KPI surfaces now show full Indian comma amounts
- **`web/lib/format.ts`**: `rupeeL` now delegates to `rupee()` always — PWA KPI tile shows `₹19,80,000` not `₹1.98L`
- **`src/integrations/gsheets.py`**: `_lk` now uses Indian comma grouping — Sheet COLLECTION summary row shows `12,90,183` not `12.90L`
- **`tests/test_first_month_rent_due.py`**: Added `booking_amount` to `_FakeTenancy` to match updated `rent_schedule.py` — 52/52 tests pass
- April 2026 sheet manually re-synced via `sync_sheet_from_db.py --write` to apply new format immediately

---

## [1.73.4] — 2026-04-27 — Day-wise handler parity (all bot flows cover daywise_stays)

### Day-wise guest parity — every handler now covers both data stores
- **`src/services/occupants.py`**: Added `stay_type == monthly` filter to first query in `find_occupants` — was returning day-stay tenancies twice (once as `kind=tenancy`, once as `kind=daystay`)
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/_shared.py`**: Added `_find_daywise_by_name`, `_find_daywise_by_room`, `_make_daywise_choices` — fallback search helpers for historical `daywise_stays` records (Excel-imported, no FK to Tenant)
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`**:
  - `_checkout_prompt` / `_update_checkout_date` / `_update_checkin` prompt functions: all fall back to `daywise_stays` when no monthly tenancy matches by name or room
  - `_do_checkout`: branches on `stay_type == daily` — calls `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync` then early-returns (skips settlement/WhatsApp template which don't apply)
  - New `_do_checkout_daywise(stay_id, checkout_date)`: sets `status=EXIT` + `checkout_date`, commits, syncs DAY WISE sheet
  - `_do_update_checkout_date` / new `_do_update_daywise_checkout_date`: validates date, updates `checkout_date` + `num_days`, commits, syncs
  - `_do_update_checkin` / new `_do_update_daywise_checkin`: same pattern for checkin date
  - Pending CHECKOUT / UPDATE_CHECKOUT_DATE / UPDATE_CHECKIN handlers: route `record_type=daywise_stays` choices to the new `_do_*_daywise` functions
  - `_query_checkins` / `_query_checkouts`: now query `daywise_stays` for same month window, merge-sort entries by date descending, label day-stay rows with `(day-stay)`; day-stay tenancies also get `(day-stay)` label
- **`src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py`**: Extended `UPDATE_CHECKOUT_DATE` regex — added `(?:update|correct|change|modify)\s+room\s+[\w-]+\s+check.?out` so "change room 218 checkout date" routes correctly
- **Golden test**: 76/105 pass; 29 pre-existing failures (none related to day-wise changes)

---

## [1.73.3] — 2026-04-27 — Vacant count sync + Sanskar cleanup + dues investigation

### Vacant beds — sheet and PWA now agree at 28
- `scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`: removed legacy `daywise_stays` table count; day-wise beds now counted from `tenancies(stay_type=daily)` only — same source as kpi.py
- `src/api/v2/kpi.py`: reverted erroneous `DaywiseStay` addition (was showing 27 instead of 28)
- VPS switched from `feature/pwa-forms-rent-collection` → `master` (master was 10 commits ahead with checkin/checkout/daywise fixes)

### Sanskar Bharadia (605) duplicate removed
- Old tenancy (749, exited, +917742488168) had Jan/Feb payments (₹56K) imported from Excel
- Active tenancy (900, +919971427645) had Mar/Apr payments — same person, split across two DB entries
- Moved Jan/Feb payments from tenancy 749 → 900, deleted tenancy 749 + tenant 752
- Sheet re-synced: EXIT row gone, all Sanskar payment history now on tenancy 900

### Total Dues ₹1,74,766 — root cause identified (no change needed)
- Previous dues ₹88,766 → jumped ₹86K after March 31 payment reclassification (prev session)
- 5 tenants (Rupali/201, Shivang/324, Jitendra/316, Sachin/215, Abhishek/121) had payments moved period_month April→March; now show UNPAID for April
- Confirmed correct per business rule (receipt date = collection month); will fix via bot when they pay

### Room 314 phone duplicate — confirmed edge case
- Bhanu Prakash 314 shares phone with spouse — husband/wife same number, legitimate

---

## [1.73.2] — 2026-04-27 — Daywise checkout fix + production deploy

### Daywise checkout routing (`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`)
- `resolve_pending_action`: routes `record_type=daywise_stays` to new `_do_checkout_daywise` (was falling through to monthly checklist)
- `_do_checkout`: triggers `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync` for `stay_type=daily` tenancies instead of calling monthly `record_checkout`
- New `_do_checkout_daywise`: marks `daywise_stays.status=EXIT`, commits, triggers DAY WISE sheet sync

### Production deploy
- Merged `feature/pwa-forms-rent-collection` → `master` (66 files, ~8700 insertions)
- VPS restarted — `api.getkozzy.com/healthz` confirmed `{"status":"ok"}`
- Vercel auto-deploy triggered for `app.getkozzy.com`

---

## [1.73.1] — 2026-04-27 — Backup cleanup + pull-to-refresh + checkin sheet sync

### Backup table dropped
- `payments_backup_20260427` (1662 rows) confirmed clean and dropped from Supabase — data integrity verified: DB = ops sheet = PWA for all 5 months

### Pull-to-refresh component (`web/components/ui/pull-to-refresh.tsx`)
- Native mobile pull-to-refresh on PWA (`web/app/layout.tsx` wraps AuthProvider with PullToRefresh)
- CSS animation `kozzy-spin` added to `web/app/globals.css`

### Checkin triggers sheet sync (`src/api/v2/checkin.py`)
- `record_physical_checkin` now calls `trigger_monthly_sheet_sync` after checkin — keeps ops sheet occupancy in sync with PWA KPI without manual resync

### Gitignore updated
- Added `.playwright-mcp/`, `web/test-results/`, `web/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, `media/` — keep test artifacts out of repo

---

## [1.73.0] — 2026-04-27 — Day-wise dedup guardrails + TENANTS master tab sync

### Day-wise tenants no longer bleed into monthly tabs (`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`)
- Added `Tenancy.stay_type != StayType.daily` filter to the monthly-tab query
- Previously any bot operation (payment, rent change) triggered `sync_sheet_from_db.py` which regenerated all monthly tabs — day-wise tenants appeared there too

### Day-wise approval now writes to TENANTS master tab (`src/api/onboarding_router.py`)
- After day-wise guest is approved + DAY WISE tab written, also calls `add_tenant(tenants_only=True, ...)` with full KYC fields
- TENANTS tab is master data — all tenants (daily and monthly) must appear there

### `add_tenant` / `_add_tenant_sync` — new `tenants_only` flag (`src/integrations/gsheets.py`)
- Pass `tenants_only=True` to write only to TENANTS master tab, skipping the monthly tab write
- Early return placed correctly inside the flag check — monthly-tab failure still returns `success=False` for monthly tenants

### ADD_TENANT bot flow disabled (`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`)
- `_add_tenant_prompt` now immediately returns redirect to `app.getkozzy.com/onboarding`
- Eliminates duplicate-creation risk (Praveen Kumar incident: bot used 11 min after form approval)
- Old form-parsing code left as dead code for reference

---

## [1.72.0] — 2026-04-27 — Data integrity: historical payments freeze + March gap fixed + deposits KPI corrected

### DB-level freeze trigger (`payments_freeze`)
- `payments_freeze_check()` trigger blocks any INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on payments rows where `period_month < date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)` — automatically advances each month
- Escape hatch: `SET LOCAL app.allow_historical_write = 'true'` in the same transaction (for legitimate admin corrections)
- Applied directly to Supabase and added to `src/database/migrate_all.py` (`run_payments_freeze_trigger_2026_04_27`) so fresh installs also get it

### Pre-April payments corrected (Dec 2025 – Mar 2026)
- **Jan 2026**: restored from `payments_backup_20260427` — Cash ₹3,00,572 / UPI ₹5,30,575 = ₹8,31,147 ✓
- **Feb 2026**: restored from backup — Cash ₹6,53,300 / UPI ₹23,24,048 = ₹29,77,348 ✓
- **Dec 2025**: restored from backup — UPI ₹12,800 only ✓
- **Mar 2026**: 9 tenants were skipped by reload script (room number mismatch between ops sheet and DB). Fixed via `scripts/fix_march_skipped.py` using name-only matching. Mar total now Cash ₹10,94,220 / UPI ₹28,89,193 = **₹39,83,413** ✓

### Deposits KPI fixed (`src/services/reporting.py`, `src/api/v2/kpi.py`)
- `deposits_breakdown()` now queries `tenancies.security_deposit + tenancies.maintenance_fee` for active tenants — correct source of truth (agreement values)
- Replaced previous `total_deposits_held()` which was summing payment transactions (gave ₹40,40,000 instead of ₹34,27,325)
- `/api/v2/app/reporting/deposits-held` returns `{ held, maintenance, refundable }` where `refundable = held - maintenance`
- PWA Money Dashboard updated to show 3-row deposits section (Refundable / Maintenance / Total)

### Cash/UPI method breakdown on Money Dashboard
- `CollectionSummaryResponse` Pydantic model now includes `method_breakdown: dict[str, int]`
- Was computed in service but silently stripped by FastAPI's response model — now correctly returned and displayed

### March 31 pre-payments reclassified
- 8 tenants who physically paid on March 31 (payment_date=2026-03-31) had period_month=April — moved to period_month=March per business rule: money received date = collection month
- Rupali, Shivang, Jitendra, Abhishek Vishwakarma, Akshit, Sachin Kumar Yadav, Yatam Ramakanth, Shashank — Cash ₹71,500 + UPI ₹53,000 moved from April → March
- March total updated: Cash 11,65,720 + UPI 29,42,193 = ₹41,07,913
- April total updated: Cash 12,90,183 + UPI 31,54,345 = ₹44,44,528

### No-show payments now counted in collection
- `sync_sheet_from_db.py`: `collected_rows` now includes `noshow_rows` — booking advance / token payments from no-show tenants count as monthly collection receipts

### Full sheet sync (DB → ops sheet, all months)
- All 5 monthly tabs (Dec 2025 – Apr 2026) written from DB using `sync_sheet_from_db.py --write` (Dec–Mar with `--force-frozen`)
- DB = ops sheet verified 3-way for Jan/Feb (source sheet also matches); Mar/Apr ops sheet matches DB

### New scripts
- `scripts/reload_pre_april_payments.py` — drop + reload Dec–Mar payments from ops sheet (semantic column lookup, safety checks, backup verification)
- `scripts/fix_march_skipped.py` — targeted fix for 9 tenants whose sheet room numbers differ from DB; name-only matching with freeze escape hatch
- `scripts/_compare_all_sources.py` — 3-way comparison utility: DB vs ops sheet vs source sheet (History tab)

---

## [1.71.0] — 2026-04-27 — PWA: KPI panels v2, money dashboard, VPS deploy at app.getkozzy.com

### PWA deployed to production
- **`app.getkozzy.com`** live on VPS (port 3001, `kozzy-pwa` systemd service, nginx proxy, Let's Encrypt SSL)
- Branch: `feature/pwa-forms-rent-collection` (running on VPS, not yet merged to master)
- Root cause of all 500s: `src/api/v2/auth.py` had stale pre-ES256 code never committed; fixed by committing all missing backend files and deploying
- CORS: added `https://app.getkozzy.com` to `main.py` `allow_origins`

### KPI panels — expanded + searchable (`web/components/home/kpi-grid.tsx`)
- **Occupied**: name/room search + rent range dropdown (All / <12k / 12–15k / 15–20k / >20k)
- **Vacant**: room search + gender pills (All / Male / Female / Empty). Shows **partial vacancies** — room with 3/4 beds taken appears as "1 bed free · Male"
- **Check-ins / Check-outs today**: name/room search + stay-type pills (All / Regular / Day-wise)
- All panels: click tenant row → inline `TenantDetailCard` showing check-in date, agreed rent, security deposit, maintenance, dues this month, last payment
- 256px fixed scroll; filters + selection reset when panel closes or tile toggled

### Backend: kpi-detail enriched (`src/api/v2/kpi.py`)
- `occupied` items: `tenancy_id`, `rent` added
- `checkins_today` items: `tenancy_id`, `rent`, `stay_type` added
- `checkouts_today` items: `tenancy_id`, `stay_type` added
- `vacant` items: rewritten with LEFT JOIN occupancy subquery + separate gender query → returns `free_beds` + `gender` (male/female/mixed/empty/unknown); partially-occupied rooms now appear
- New endpoint `GET /api/v2/app/reporting/deposits-held` → cumulative non-voided deposit sum (all time)

### Backend: tenant dues endpoint (`src/api/v2/tenants.py`)
- `GET /api/v2/app/tenants/{tenancy_id}/dues` now returns `checkin_date`, `security_deposit`, `maintenance_fee`

### Backend: reporting service (`src/services/reporting.py`)
- `CollectionSummary` — added `method_breakdown: dict[str, int]` (grouped by payment_mode, rent+maintenance only)
- New `total_deposits_held(*, session) -> int` — all-time cumulative deposit payments (non-voided)

### Backend: auth (`src/api/v2/auth.py`)
- Switched HS256 → **ES256 via PyJWKClient** (PyJWT + cryptography). Supabase uses ECC keys; old HMAC-based check was crashing every VPS API call with 500.

### Money dashboard (`web/app/collection/breakdown/page.tsx`)
- Server component with `searchParams: Promise<{ month?: string }>`
- Month navigation `‹ April 2026 ›` via `?month=YYYY-MM` links; `›` disabled on current month
- Sections: summary + progress bar, rent collected (pure rent + maintenance split), payment method breakdown (Cash/UPI/Bank transfer/Cheque), pending dues, deposits held (cumulative), deposits received this month (shown separately, not in collection total)

### Frontend API layer (`web/lib/api.ts`)
- `CollectionSummary`: `method_breakdown: Record<string, number>`
- `KpiDetailItem`: `rent?`, `free_beds?`, `gender?`, `stay_type?`
- `TenantDues`: `checkin_date`, `security_deposit`, `maintenance_fee`
- New: `getDepositsHeld()`, `getKpiDetail()`, `getTenantDues()`

### New auth/session infrastructure
- `web/lib/auth-server.ts` — server-side `getSession()` via `createSupabaseServer()`
- `web/lib/supabase-server.ts` — `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` with Next.js cookies()
- `web/middleware.ts` — refresh Supabase tokens on every request

### Infrastructure
- Cloudflare DNS for `getkozzy.com` under `kirankumarpemmasani@gmail.com` (not `cozeevoemp1@gmail.com`) — noted in memory

---

## [1.70.0] — 2026-04-27 — April dues reconciliation, sync shutdown, PWA voice fix, VPS deploy

### April data cleanup (one-time ops)
- **`scripts/fix_april_dues.py`** (new) — reconciles April DB balances against "april dues .xlsx": sets exact adjustment field for 18 people with dues, zeroes 30 others, all tagged `adjustment_note="MANUAL_LOCK"` so no formula ever overwrites them
- **APScheduler job purged** — `overnight_source_sync` job was persisted in `apscheduler_jobs` DB table even though the code was commented out; deleted directly from DB. This was the root cause of duplicate tenancies (Praveen Kumar, Tanya Rishikesh) being created by 3 AM syncs
- **Sync endpoints de-registered** — `sync_router` (`/api/sync/source-sheet`) and `/api/admin/rotate-token` removed from `main.py`; all source-sheet auto-syncs are now fully off
- **Tanya Rishikesh duplicate resolved** — deleted second tenancy (1054) + tenant (933) created by consecutive sync runs; moved auto-synced payment to correct tenancy (919)
- **Total dues KPI fixed** — `scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py` no longer includes no-show tenants in total dues; KPI dropped from ₹2,65,203 → ₹88,766 (active tenants only; no-shows count in the month they check in)

### PWA voice — complete rewrite (no backend calls)
- **`web/lib/voice.ts`** — replaced `useVoiceRecorder` (MediaRecorder → Whisper upload) with `useSpeechInput` (browser-native `SpeechRecognition` API); transcription is now on-device, zero network calls
- **`web/lib/parse-intent.ts`** (new) — client-side JS parser extracts amount, name, room, method from transcript using regex; replaces Groq LLM intent extraction API call entirely
- **`web/components/voice/voice-sheet.tsx`** — removed two-step Whisper → LLM pipeline; now speech → local parse → confirm card. Added `VoiceSummary` component that tells user in plain English what was and wasn't understood ("Got ₹8,000, Ravi. Still need: payment method")
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — removed `transcribeAudio`, `TranscribeResponse`, `_postForm`; default `BASE_URL` changed from `http://localhost:8000` to `https://api.getkozzy.com` (fixes "Failed to fetch" on production)

### VPS deploy
- PWA rebuilt and restarted on VPS (`kozzy-pwa.service`); `app.getkozzy.com` now serving latest build pointing to `https://api.getkozzy.com`

### Branch
`feature/pwa-forms-rent-collection` — all changes on this branch, not yet merged to master

---

## [1.69.1] — 2026-04-27 — Hotfix: onboarding form submission failure

### Fixed
- **`src/api/onboarding_router.py`** — 4 occurrences of `from services import storage` changed to `from src.services import storage`. The top-level `services/` package has no `storage` module; the import crashed `tenant_submit`, `approve`, and staff-signature GET/POST handlers. The error propagated through `LocalOnlyMiddleware.call_next()`, dropping the HTTP connection — so `res.json()` failed on the client and showed the fallback "Submission failed. Please try again." instead of a real error message.

### Root cause
Wrong import path introduced when KYC file upload was added (commit `97cec97`, 2026-04-19). `src.services.storage` is the correct path (consistent with all other imports in the same file). The top-level `services/` stub has only `property_logic.py`.

### Deployed
Cherry-picked to master, VPS restarted. Confirmed clean startup via journalctl.

---

## [1.69.0] — 2026-04-27 — PWA rent collection form: numpad, tenant search, dues preview, E2E tests

### Built
- **`src/api/v2/tenants.py`** — two new endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v2/app/tenants/search?q=` — fuzzy search active/no_show tenancies by name/room/phone (max 10)
  - `GET /api/v2/app/tenants/{tenancy_id}/dues` — current month dues (rent − payments), last payment info
- **`src/api/v2/app_router.py`** — registered tenants router
- **`src/api/v2/payments.py`** — fixed critical Sheet sync gap: now calls `gsheets.update_payment()` after DB commit (same 10s timeout pattern as WhatsApp handler — was silently missing before)
- **`web/lib/api.ts`** — added `searchTenants()`, `getTenantDues()`, `TenantSearchResult`, `TenantDues` interfaces
- **`web/components/forms/tenant-search.tsx`** — debounced autocomplete with dropdown + selected pill + clear
- **`web/components/forms/confirmation-card.tsx`** — universal bottom-sheet safety gate before any DB write
- **`web/components/forms/numpad.tsx`** — phone-style numpad (suggest-amount pills, 0 spans 2 cols, backspace)
- **`web/app/payment/new/page.tsx`** — full rebuild: TenantSearch → dues preview → Numpad → method tiles → ConfirmationCard → VoiceSheet → success screen
- **`web/e2e/payment-collection.spec.ts`** — 10/10 Playwright scenarios passing (numpad, error states, method pills, voice button)
- **`web/playwright.config.ts`** — created with chromium + webServer auto-start config

### UI mockups created (approved by Kiran)
- `.superpowers/brainstorm/ui-options/payment-collection.html` — 3 states × mobile + web
- `.superpowers/brainstorm/ui-options/dashboard-expandable.html` — expandable KPI tiles + Smart Query bar

### Design decisions (approved)
- **Numpad** for amount entry (phone-style, like Powdur) — not text input
- **Mobile hybrid** (phone frame + bottom sheet) AND **web left sidebar** — both required
- **Dashboard KPI tiles are expandable** — tap tile → inline list (dues, check-ins, checkouts, occupancy)
- **Smart Query** replaces "Dues Query" everywhere — AI bar that answers any operational question ("female double-sharing rooms with 1 bed free?")
- **Check-in + checkout forms** must be adapted to same design (next session work)

### Branch
`feature/pwa-forms-rent-collection` pushed to GitHub. Needs merge + VPS deploy.

### Tests
- Backend: 11 new tests (v2 tenants) passing, 52 pre-push unit tests passing
- Frontend: 10 Playwright E2E scenarios passing, tsc zero errors, Next.js build clean

---

## [1.68.0] — 2026-04-26 — Product pivot: Kozzy Digital Receptionist (forms + voice + WhatsApp)

### Decision
Strategic pivot from WhatsApp-only bot to three-track platform:
- **Track A (forms)** — PWA staff app for Lokesh: collect payment, check-in, checkout, dues, day-wise, rental changes. Critical path. Ships first.
- **Track B (voice)** — "Hey Kozzy" wake word + tap-to-talk on shared reception phone. Groq Whisper Turbo. EN/TA/TE/HI. Ships after forms.
- **Track C (WhatsApp)** — Existing bot maintained for owners + tenants. No new features required.

### Why
Receptionist (Lokesh) cannot use natural language chat reliably for financial data entry. Staff have phones only — no laptops. Forms + voice = right interface for front desk.

### What WhatsApp commands do
Continue working for owners (Kiran, Prabhakaran) and tenants. Three frontends, one backend, one DB.

### Pricing updated
- Growth ₹799 — forms app added
- Pro ₹1999 — forms + voice added

### Docs updated
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-kozzy-digital-receptionist-design.md` — full product spec
- `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` — three-track plan + confidence levels
- `docs/business/PRICING.md` — forms + voice tiers added

### Implementation plan
Next: `writing-plans` skill → implementation plan for Track A (forms critical path).
Three-agent parallel execution: Agent A (forms), Agent B (voice), Agent C (WhatsApp parity).

---

## [1.67.0] — 2026-04-26 — DASHBOARD_SUMMARY handler: all 6 Sheet rows queryable via bot

### Added
- `DASHBOARD_SUMMARY` intent + `_dashboard_summary` handler in `account_handler.py`
  - Row 1 OCCUPANCY: total beds, occupied (regular/premium beds/day-stay), vacant tonight, reserved (no-show), available long-term
  - Row 2 BUILDINGS: THOR + HULK occupied beds and tenant count
  - Row 3 COLLECTION: collected (rent+maint), month target, previous month dues
  - Row 4 STATUS: paid/partial/unpaid/no-show counts for current month
  - Row 5 NOTICE: upcoming vacates grouped by month (expected_checkout)
  - Row 6 DEPOSITS: held / maintenance / refundable totals
- Intent triggers: "dashboard", "show dashboard", "full dashboard", "all stats", "property overview", "full overview"
- Added to `FINANCIAL_INTENTS` + `handle_account()` dispatcher
- 5 new golden tests G101–G105; 80/105 suite passing, 0 regressions
- Deployed and verified on VPS

### Known issue (next session)
- COLLECTION "dues" line shows previous month outstanding; Kiran flagged should show current month outstanding — fix pending

### Docs
- `docs/BOT_FLOWS.md` — DASHBOARD_SUMMARY + SHOW_MASTER_DATA added to intent catalog
- `docs/RECEPTIONIST_CHEAT_SHEET.md` — DASHBOARD SUMMARY section added

## [1.66.3] — 2026-04-26 — Sheet→DB reload: April 2026 + Day Wise

### New script: `scripts/reload_from_sheet.py`
Drop+reload April 2026 and Day Wise data in DB from Google Sheet (sheet = source of truth).
- `reload_april()`: drops April rent RS + rent Payments, reloads from APRIL 2026 tab (cash+UPI, skips NO_SHOW, deduplicates RS per tenancy)
- `reload_daywise()`: drops all `stay_type=daily` tenancies + payments, reloads from DAY WISE tab
- RS status reconcile: after loading, marks each April RS `paid/partial/pending` based on payments (217 paid, 18 partial, 5 pending after April reload)
- `resync_tenants_master()`: adds monthly tenants missing from TENANTS tab; deduplicates by phone+name to prevent re-adding across runs
- Usage: `venv/Scripts/python scripts/reload_from_sheet.py` (dry run), `--write` to apply

### Bugfixes
- `scripts/import_april.py`: added `entered_by="excel_import"` to Tenancy (was None — untraceable)
- `scripts/resync_missing_tenants_to_sheet.py`: filter `stay_type != daily` (daywise guests don't belong in TENANTS master)

### Root cause: Navdaap missing from TENANTS
`import_april.py --write` (no `--sheet` flag) wrote DB only; `sync_sheet_from_db.py` later wrote to April tab; TENANTS master never updated. Fixed by resync_tenants_master.

### Pending balance: 3.27L (sheet) vs bot
Sheet 3.27L = ALL balances including 18 NO_SHOW rows (booking advances). Excluding NO_SHOW = 3.09L. Bot counts active monthly tenants only — structural gap, not a bug.

---

## [1.66.2] — 2026-04-26 — Debug: Prashant onboarding session investigation

### Investigation only — no code changed
- Prashant (9080887810) onboarding session showed "Cancelled" — Kiran thought it was lost
- Root cause: session created Apr 25 at 10:32 UTC with 2-hour expiry window (old bug, now fixed to 48h); link expired at 18:02 IST before Prashant filled it
- Lokesh manually cancelled the expired session; then added Prashant via WhatsApp bot instead
- Tenancy IS active: Prasanth.P, Room G09, ₹10,500/month, checked in Apr 25 — nothing lost
- Missing KYC on Prashant's record: no ID proof type/number, no email, no selfie/signature, no agreement PDF (added via bot, not form)

---

## [1.66.1] — 2026-04-26 — Design session: OCR onboarding

### Discussion only — no code changed
- Explored onboarding via form OCR: receptionist WhatsApps photo of filled paper form → extract fields → pre-fill onboarding session
- Recommendation: Claude Haiku vision (`claude-haiku-4-5`) via Anthropic API — best accuracy for structured form extraction
- Alternative: Groq llama-4-scout (vision) — stays single-vendor but less reliable for key-value extraction
- Bot commands for onboarding documented: `start onboarding for [Name]`, `onboarding status`, `approve onboarding [id]`
- ADD_TENANT deprecation confirmed (2026-04-24); unified web form is the only path

---

## [1.66.0] — 2026-04-26 — Master data audit: 291→294 beds + room corrections

### DB corrections (live)
- **Room 114** (Pooja + Arun RL, tenancy 895+896): `status=exited→active`, `checkout_date=2026-05-19`. Audit_log written.
- **G05**: `is_staff_room=False→True` — was wrongly marked as revenue (3 extra beds). Staff triple.
- **G13**: `room_type='double'→'triple'` — inconsistent with `max_occupancy=3`. Now correct.
- **G20**: Confirmed `is_staff_room=True` (temp staff room until April 2026 end; returns to revenue in May).
- **12 corner rooms** (THOR x01/x12, HULK x13/x24): verified `room_type='single', max_occ=1` — physically single beds, NOT room attributes of premium sharing.

### Bed count corrected: 291→294
- Root cause: G05 wrongly revenue (+3 beds) and G20 wrongly staff (−1 bed) = net +2 vs 295 expected.
- 114+618 confirmed revenue (already correct in DB after prior session fix).
- Correct formula: `27×1 + 126×2 + 5×3 = 27+252+15 = 294`.
- G20 temporary staff until April end → returns to revenue May 2026 → 295 beds from May.

### Files updated: 291→294
- `docs/MASTER_DATA.md` — complete rewrite: staff table, revenue counts, floor layouts, changelog
- `docs/BRAIN.md` — staff rooms table + revenue summary
- `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` — TOTAL_BEDS constant + staff rooms list
- `docs/REPORTING.md` — TOTAL_REVENUE_BEDS constant + staff rooms excluded
- `docs/SHEET_LOGIC.md` — Vacant formula + occupancy %
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py:175` — `TOTAL_BEDS = 294`
- `scripts/clean_and_load.py:23` — `TOTAL_BEDS = 294`
- `scripts/gsheet_apps_script.js:25` — `const TOTAL_BEDS = 294`
- `scripts/gsheet_dashboard_webapp.js:19` — `const TOTAL_BEDS = 294`
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py:2121` — fallback 294

### New: `show master data` bot command
- `SHOW_MASTER_DATA` intent (update_handler.py `show_master_data()`) — live DB query of staff rooms + revenue bed count per property
- Bot replies with current staff rooms, revenue rooms/beds per building and total
- Includes reminder to compare with MASTER_DATA.md and update if different
- `_update_single_room` (mark/unmark staff room) now appends doc-update reminder in reply

### Memory / pending tasks
- `memory/reference_master_data.md` updated: 294 beds, corrected staff list, G20 temp note
- `memory/project_pending_tasks.md` updated: G20→revenue (May), room 114 May rent (Rs.7,967 each)

---

## [1.65.0] — 2026-04-26 — Delete HTML dashboard + fix daywise tenant balance display

### Removed: HTML web dashboard
- Deleted `src/dashboard/` module (cleanup.py, html_generator.py, __init__.py)
- Deleted `src/api/dashboard_router.py` (561 lines)
- Deleted `static/dashboard.html`
- Removed all `main.py` wiring: cleanup scheduler, `/dashboards` static mount, `GET /dashboard` route, dashboard_router include, `/api/report/dashboard` endpoint, dashboard branch in token rotation
- Removed stale test scripts that imported deleted module: `tests/diag_dues3.py`, `tests/test_dues_month_scope.py`
- `src/reports/report_generator.py` cleaned up: removed `dashboard_dir`, `generate_dashboard()` method

### Fixed: daywise tenant balance display (`_do_query_tenant_by_id`)
- "Maharajan balance" now shows correct daywise view: `Rs.X/day`, days stayed, total owed, total paid, balance due, individual payment history
- Previously showed broken data: `Rs.X/month`, "This month: No record" (because daywise tenants have no RentSchedule rows), and "All dues cleared!" (from empty outstanding calc)

### Investigation: daywise tenant fallback in all handlers
- All handler lookups (`_find_active_tenants_by_name`, `_find_active_tenants_by_room`) have **no `stay_type` filter** — daywise tenants are already found by every handler
- COLLECT_RENT, CHECKOUT, UPDATE_RENT, VOID_PAYMENT, QUERY_RECEIPT all work correctly for daywise tenants (no fallback needed, single shared lookup returns both types)
- `_query_dues` (who owes) already had separate daywise block — confirmed correct
- 52/52 unit tests pass; daywise e2e 6/6 pass

---

## [1.65.1] — 2026-04-26 — Day-wise sheet column parity, semantic refs, dues clearance

### Fixed: "Could you clarify?" on basic payment commands
- **Root cause**: `USE_PYDANTIC_AGENTS=true` on VPS + `AGENT_INTENTS` defaulting to `"CHECKOUT,PAYMENT_LOG"` → all payment messages routed to LangGraph agent which failed validation and returned "Could you clarify?" instead of logging the payment
- **Fix**: Set `USE_PYDANTIC_AGENTS=false` on VPS. Agent work moved to `agent-dev` branch — must not run in production without explicit re-enable approval.

### Fixed: day-wise rent change not syncing to sheet
- **Root cause**: `owner_handler.py` day-wise rent confirm handler called `trigger_monthly_sheet_sync()` instead of `trigger_daywise_sheet_sync()`
- **Fix**: One-line correction in `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`

### Improved: `scripts/sync_daywise_from_db.py` — full column parity + semantic refs
- **27 columns** now matching every field from the day-wise onboarding form + DB (was ~18, missing Building, Sharing, Checkout, Security Dep, Maintenance, all KYC fields)
- **Inclusive day count**: `(checkout - checkin).days + 1` — Apr 10→Apr 30 = 21 days (was 20)
- **Building**: eager-loaded via `selectinload(Room.property)`, strips "Cozeevo " prefix → THOR/HULK
- **Semantic column refs**: `C = {h: i for i, h in enumerate(HEADERS)}` dict — replaces all `r[14]`-style magic indices. Enforced as project standard.
- **Dict-based row build**: each row built as `{col_name: value}`, converted to ordered list via `HEADERS` at write time — column order can never drift
- **`col_letter(n)`** helper: correct A/Z/AA/AB notation (fixes `chr(ord("A")+26)` → `"["` formatting bug for >26 columns)

### New: `scripts/clear_daywise_dues.py`
- One-time script to zero out outstanding balances for all exited day-wise tenancies
- Inserts a `for_type=other` clearing payment (not classified as rent) with note "Balance write-off — dues received but not recorded"
- Skips active tenancies and tenancies where balance ≤ 0
- **Ran on 2026-04-26**: cleared 21 tenancies, Rs.1,70,050 total. Sheet shows Balance=0 for all exited stays.

### Memory
- `feedback_sheet_column_references.md` — standard: always `C["ColName"]` + `col_letter()`, never `r[index]` or `chr(ord("A")+n)`

---

## [1.64.0] — 2026-04-26 — Staff KYC onboarding + daywise rent change e2e tests

### New: ADD_STAFF intent + KYC document upload
- **`add staff [name] | role | salary | dob | phone | aadhar | room [num]`** — single-message bulk input creates a staff record with all details, then prompts for ID photo
- **KYC flow**: bot asks for Aadhar/ID photo or PDF; user sends media → downloaded from WhatsApp Cloud API → uploaded to Supabase Storage `kyc-documents/staff/` → URL saved to `staff.kyc_document_url`, `kyc_verified=True`
- **Skip**: reply `skip` to register staff without KYC; flagged as `⚠ KYC pending` in `show staff rooms`
- **Validation**: wrong MIME type rejected with re-prompt; non-media reply keeps pending alive
- **`assign staff [name] room [room]`**: no longer silently creates bare staff record — returns `add staff` help prompt when name not found

### DB schema: Staff table additions
- `salary NUMERIC(10,2)` — monthly salary
- `date_of_birth DATE`
- `aadhar_number VARCHAR(20)`
- `kyc_document_url VARCHAR(500)` — Supabase Storage public URL
- `kyc_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`
- Migration: `run_add_staff_kyc_fields_2026_04_26` — runs in own transaction to avoid deadlock rollback from `run_allow_unassigned_room_2026_04_24`

### New: media_handler helpers
- `download_whatsapp_media_bytes(media_id)` — downloads from WhatsApp, returns `(bytes, mime_type)` without saving to disk
- `upload_staff_kyc_to_supabase(media_id, staff_id, mime_type)` — download + upload in one call

### E2E tests
- **`tests/test_daywise_rent_e2e.py`** (new, 6/6): daywise rent change yes/no confirmation — command → pending, Yes → rate updated, No → rate unchanged, unrelated message → pending kept alive
- **`tests/test_disambig_e2e.py`**: 15/15 pass — staff ASSIGN_STAFF_ROOM + EXIT_STAFF disambig confirmed working
- **`tests/test_full_flow_e2e.py`**: ASSIGN_STAFF_ROOM + EXIT_STAFF full flows confirmed

### Fixed
- **Intent regex**: `ADD_STAFF` pattern uses `[A-Za-z][^\|]+\|` (was `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z ]+\|`) — now handles names with digits (e.g. TestKYC999)
- **`sync_daywise_from_db.py`**: `active_count` now only counts tenancies where `checkout_date >= today` — was showing 6 instead of 1

---

## [1.63.2] — 2026-04-26 — Checkout form UX fixes + WhatsApp template for guaranteed delivery

### Checkout form (`static/checkout_admin.html`)
- **Refund mode no longer required when refund = 0** — validation skips if refund amount is zero
- **Manual WhatsApp/copy link added** — after form submission, status box shows "Copy Link" + "Open WhatsApp" buttons as fallback; WhatsApp opens pre-filled with tenant phone + confirm link

### WhatsApp delivery (`src/api/checkout_router.py`, `src/whatsapp/webhook_handler.py`)
- **Root cause of silent failures**: checkout was sending free-form text via `_send_whatsapp`, silently dropped by Meta for users outside the 24h window
- **Fix**: switched to `checkout_review` template (UTILITY, "Review & Confirm" URL button → `https://api.getkozzy.com/checkout/{token}`) — bypasses 24h window
- **Fallback**: free-form text if template send fails
- **`_send_whatsapp_template`** extended with `url_button_token` param for URL button templates
- **`checkout_review` template** submitted to Meta (ID 1733208487500578, PENDING approval)

---

## [1.63.1] — 2026-04-26 — Fix checkout/check-in form correction flow + testing SOP

### Bug fix: field revert in multi-step OCR form corrections
- **Root cause**: `CHECKOUT_FORM_CONFIRM` and `FORM_EXTRACT_CONFIRM` were calling `_save_pending()` on edit (creates new PendingAction), then returning without `__KEEP_PENDING__`. Timing between new-pending creation and old-pending resolution could cause field revert.
- **Fix**: Update `pending.action_data` directly on the ORM object + return `__KEEP_PENDING__` prefix. No new PendingAction created. Field state guaranteed to persist across turns.
- Lokesh bug: room 906→206 was reverting to 906 when phone was corrected next — now fixed.

### New: phone mismatch guardrail (CHECKOUT_FORM_CONFIRM)
- When form has matching name/room but phone ≠ DB records, bot warns user before proceeding
- Step: `phone_mismatch` — user must reply *yes* (proceed anyway) or *edit phone [correct]* to fix
- Prevents silent wrong-tenant checkout when OCR misreads phone number

### Improved: checkout form edit reliability
- Added regex `edit field_name value` path before LLM fallback (same as check-in form)
- LLM (`_parse_checkout_edit_nl`) is now only called for natural-language edits, not structured `edit X Y` commands
- Natural language edits still work via LLM fallback

### Testing SOP
- Updated `memory/sop_testing.md` with mandatory mid-flow correction test matrix
- Regression test added to `tests/test_form_extract_flow.py`:
  - `checkin multi-edit: name held after phone edit`
  - `checkout multi-edit: room held (no revert)` — the Lokesh bug
- 48/48 tests pass on VPS

### Files changed
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py` — CHECKOUT_FORM_CONFIRM + FORM_EXTRACT_CONFIRM handlers
- `tests/test_form_extract_flow.py` — new multi-turn correction + checkout OCR tests

---

## [1.63.0] — 2026-04-26 — Day-Wise Parity: all guests in Tenancy(stay_type=daily)

### Architecture change
- Unified day-wise stays into `Tenancy(stay_type=daily)` — `DaywiseStay` table retained as archive, all new writes use `Tenancy`
- All bot handlers, sheet columns, and payment flows now treat day-stays identically to monthly tenants

### Migration (VPS)
- `scripts/migrate_daywise_to_tenancy.py`: migrated 33 DaywiseStay rows → Tenancy + Payment; 66 skipped (no phone); 2 skipped (duplicates)
- Migration is idempotent (source_file=MIGRATED tombstone + duplicate check)

### New/changed files
- **`src/services/occupants.py`**: day-stay query uses `Tenancy(stay_type=daily)` — no more DaywiseStay
- **`src/services/room_occupancy.py`**: `RoomOccupants.daywise: list[Tenancy]`; all 3 occupancy callsites updated
- **`src/api/onboarding_router.py`**: `is_daily` approval path writes Tenancy + Payment
- **`scripts/import_daywise.py`**: Excel import writes Tenancy instead of DaywiseStay
- **`src/integrations/gsheets.py`**: DAY WISE tab uses MONTHLY_HEADERS (19 cols); `update_payment` routes daily-stay payments to DAY WISE tab via `is_daily=True`
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py`**: QUERY_DUES includes daily-tenant balances; removed DAYWISE_RENT_CHANGE handler; `gsheets_update` passes `is_daily`
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`**: removed ROOM_TRANSFER_DW_*, DAYWISE_RENT_CHANGE_WHO handlers; `_find_active_daywise_by_name` removed
- **`scripts/sync_daywise_from_db.py`**: rewrites DAY WISE tab from Tenancy(stay_type=daily) with MONTHLY_HEADERS
- DAY WISE sheet: 33 rows written (6 active guests, Rs.5.36L total revenue)

### Deployed
- VPS restarted, service active

---

## [1.62.1] — 2026-04-26 — Phone normalization: DB + Sheet in sync

### DB migration
- Normalized 6 raw 10-digit tenant phones to `+91XXXXXXXXXX` format in DB (`tenants` table)
- DB now has uniform phone format: all real phones stored as `+91XXXXXXXXXX`, NOPHONE_ placeholders unchanged

### Sheet sync
- Re-synced April 2026 monthly tab from DB — 282 rows written with normalized phones
- `sync_sheet_from_db.py --write` regenerates monthly tab from DB (tenant.phone = DB value)
- Principle enforced: Sheet is a mirror of DB; same field, same format everywhere

### Context
- `canonical_phone()` (shipped previous session) normalizes all NEW writes
- This migration cleans up the 6 existing records that pre-dated that function
- NOPHONE_ placeholders (13 records) are intentional — left unchanged

---

## [1.62.0] — 2026-04-26 — PWA Plan 1 Tasks 16–22: voice, payment page, collection breakdown

### Voice pipeline (Tasks 16–18)
- `web/lib/voice.ts` — `useVoiceRecorder()` hook: MediaRecorder API, webm+opus / mp4 fallback, mic permission request, chunk streaming
- `web/components/voice/mic-button.tsx` — standalone mic button (reusable)
- `web/components/voice/voice-sheet.tsx` — full-screen modal: records → transcribes → extracts intent → shows confirm view with extracted fields; handles errors at each stage
- `src/services/voice.py` — Groq Whisper Large v3 Turbo transcription wrapper
- `src/services/intent_voice.py` — PydanticAI + Llama 3.3 70B payment intent extraction (`log_payment` / `check_balance` / `unknown`); falls back to raw Groq JSON mode if PydanticAI not installed
- `src/schemas/voice.py` — `TranscribeResponse`, `IntentRequest`, `PaymentIntentResponse` Pydantic models
- `src/api/v2/voice.py` — `POST /api/v2/app/voice/transcribe` (multipart audio → Whisper) + `POST /api/v2/app/voice/intent` (transcript → structured intent); both admin/staff only
- Registered in `app_router.py`

### Payment entry screen (Task 19)
- `web/app/payment/new/page.tsx` — voice-first payment form: pre-fills from voice intent (via URL params from HomeTabBar, or direct VoiceSheet confirm); manual fallback for all fields; success flash with amount + method

### Collection breakdown screen (Tasks 21–22)
- `web/app/collection/breakdown/page.tsx` — server component, reads `/api/v2/app/reporting/collection`; 3 sections per REPORTING.md §4.2: "Counted in Total" (rent + maintenance), "Pending", "Tracked separately (NOT in total)" (deposits + advances)
- Home page: tapping overview card navigates to breakdown

### Tab bar + voice flow wiring (Tasks 16/19)
- `web/components/home/home-tab-bar.tsx` — client component with 5-tab bottom nav; centre CTA opens VoiceSheet, on intent navigates to `/payment/new?amount=...&method=...`; replaces inline `HomeTabBar` placeholder
- Home page updated: renders `<HomeTabBar>` below content, overview card wrapped in `<Link href="/collection/breakdown">`

### API additions
- `web/lib/api.ts` — `transcribeAudio(blob, mime)` → `_postForm` multipart; `extractPaymentIntent(transcript)` → JSON; `TranscribeResponse` + `PaymentIntent` types

### VPS: deployed, service active

---

## [1.61.0] — 2026-04-26 — PWA Plan 1 Tasks 4/5/9/10 + checkout web confirm page

### Backend: `/api/v2/app/payments` + `/api/v2/app/reporting/collection`
- `POST /api/v2/app/payments` — JWT-authenticated payment logging via the Owner PWA; resolves active tenancy from `tenant_id`, calls `src/services/payments.log_payment`, returns `payment_id` + `new_balance`; 409 on duplicate hash
- `GET /api/v2/app/reporting/collection?period_month=YYYY-MM` — collection summary per REPORTING.md §4.2; returns `expected`, `collected` (rent+maintenance only), `pending`, `collection_pct`, breakdowns, `overdue_count`
- `src/schemas/payments.py` + `src/schemas/reporting.py` — Pydantic request/response models
- `src/services/reporting.py` — `collection_summary()` async service using existing SQLAlchemy models

### Frontend: UI primitives + Supabase auth layer
- `web/components/ui/` — Card, Button, ProgressBar, IconTile, Pill, TabBar (design tokens from tailwind.config.ts)
- `web/lib/supabase.ts` — createBrowserClient wrapper; `web/lib/auth.ts` — signInWithPhone, verifyOtp, getSession, signOut; `web/lib/api.ts` — typed fetch client for backend endpoints
- `web/components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` — AuthProvider context + useAuth hook; wired into `app/layout.tsx`
- Installed `@supabase/ssr@0.10.2` and `@supabase/supabase-js@2.104.1`

### Checkout: web-based confirm page
- `/checkout/{token}` — tenant-facing HTML page to review and confirm/dispute checkout (replaced inline YES/NO WhatsApp flow)
- WhatsApp message now sends a link: `https://api.getkozzy.com/checkout/{token}`
- `GET /api/checkout/summary/{token}`, `/confirm`, `/dispute` — public endpoints (token is the auth)

## [1.60.0] — 2026-04-26 — Security hygiene: sig-check hardening, correlation IDs, /media auth, token rotation

### Remove WHATSAPP_SKIP_SIG_CHECK bypass (`webhook_handler.py`)
- Env var escape hatch removed entirely; signature check is now unconditional
- Was never set on VPS, but the bypass path no longer exists in code

### Request correlation IDs (`webhook_handler.py`, `chat_api.py`)
- Meta `msg_id` now passed through as `message_id` on `InboundMessage` (was always `None`)
- `_process_message_inner` derives a 12-char `req_id` from `message_id` (or new UUID)
- Three log lines per request: entry (`phone`, `msg[:60]`), intent (`intent`, `conf`, `role`), routing (`intent`)
- Traces a message from webhook → intent detection → handler dispatch without touching handlers

### `/media` endpoint: unauthenticated static mount → PIN-protected (`main.py`)
- Replaced `StaticFiles("/media")` mount with `GET /media/{path:path}` that requires admin PIN
- Accepts `X-Admin-Pin` header or `?pin=` query param (same as all other admin endpoints)
- Path traversal guard: rejects any path that resolves outside `media_dir`
- `admin_onboarding.html`: local `/media/` image URLs now append `?pin=<ADMIN_PIN>`

### Token rotation endpoint (`main.py`)
- `POST /api/admin/rotate-token?which=dashboard|sync|all` (localhost-only + admin PIN)
- Generates new `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` tokens, updates in-memory vars immediately via `sys.modules`
- Writes new values to `.env` file for persistence across restarts
- Returns new token value(s) in response so admin can update callers

### Cheat sheet Section 0 (`docs/CHEAT_SHEET_PRINTABLE.md`)
- Added "SOMEONE CAME TO PAY" as the first section, above Section 1
- Three options: check balance first / step-by-step / one-shot
- Notes on multi-name disambiguation and cash+UPI split

---

## [1.59.0] — 2026-04-25 — Security hardening: auth header, MIME validation, log permissions, retry

### Dashboard auth: query param → Authorization header
- `dashboard_router.py`: `_auth` now reads `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header instead of `?token=`
- Dev mode still works (token empty → auth skipped)
- `Query` retained for all other endpoint params

### File upload MIME validation (`main.py`)
- Extension check: only `.csv` and `.pdf` accepted (was accepting any extension)
- MIME check: `Content-Type` validated against allowed set (`text/csv`, `application/pdf`, etc.)
- Returns HTTP 400 with clear message on invalid type

### Debug log permissions (`chat_api.py`, `webhook_handler.py`)
- All `/tmp/pg_*.log` writes now use `os.open(..., 0o600)` → owner-only, not world-readable
- Protects PII (phone numbers, message content) from other processes on VPS

### WhatsApp send retry on 429/5xx (`webhook_handler.py`)
- `_send_whatsapp` now retries up to 3 times on 429 (rate limit) and 5xx (transient)
- 429: respects `Retry-After` header, caps wait at 120s
- 5xx / network error: exponential backoff (5s, 10s)

---

## [1.58.0] — 2026-04-25 — E2E test suite: RECORD_CHECKOUT + ADD_TENANT confirm + SOP update

### test_full_flow_e2e.py: 33 → 35 scenarios
Two previously-missing intents now covered end-to-end:
- **RECORD_CHECKOUT full flow** — creates test tenant+tenancy, routes "checkout [name]" → "1" → walks 5-question checklist (keys/damage/fingerprint/deductions) → "yes", verifies `CheckoutRecord` created and `tenancy.status=exited`, full cleanup in `finally`
- **ADD_TENANT confirm → DB** — injects `CONFIRM_ADD_TENANT` pending with future checkin, routes "yes", verifies `Tenant`+`Tenancy` rows created, full cleanup

### SOP update (`memory/sop_testing.md`)
Added mandatory rule: every new handler must have a corresponding E2E test in `test_full_flow_e2e.py` before shipping. Rule includes pattern reference to newest tests.

---

## [1.57.0] — 2026-04-25 — E2E test suite: 7 missing intents + pre-push hook

### test_full_flow_e2e.py: 26 → 33 scenarios
Seven previously-uncovered intents now have full happy-path DB-verified E2E tests:
- **EXIT_STAFF** — creates test staff with room assignment, routes "staff X exit", verifies `active=False`
- **VOID_EXPENSE** — creates expense in DB, routes "void expense", picks #1, verifies `is_void=True`
- **SCHEDULE_CHECKOUT** — routes "schedule checkout for X 15 Dec 2027", verifies `tenancy.expected_checkout` set, reverts
- **ASSIGN_ROOM** — creates unassigned tenant + finds free room, routes "assign room N to X", verifies Tenancy created, cleans up
- **COMPLAINT_UPDATE (resolve)** — creates open Complaint in DB, routes "resolve complaint N", verifies `status=resolved`
- **MY_BALANCE (tenant role)** — creates tenant CallerContext, routes "my balance", verifies non-empty reply
- **MY_PAYMENTS (tenant role)** — same with "my payments"

All tests: cleanup on pass AND fail; safe on live DB.

## [1.56.0] — 2026-04-25 — Schema migrations: CASCADE + payment dedup

### rent_schedules FK → ON DELETE CASCADE
- `rent_schedules.tenancy_id` FK upgraded to `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- No data touched (tenancies are never hard-deleted — policy is status/is_void)
- Only fires if a test tenancy is manually deleted — cascade cleans up its rent schedule rows automatically

### payments.unique_hash dedup
- New nullable `unique_hash VARCHAR(64)` column added to `payments` table
- Partial unique index `uq_payment_unique_hash` (`WHERE unique_hash IS NOT NULL`)
- `payments.py`: MD5 hash of `tenancy_id:date:amount:mode:period_month:for_type` set on every new bot payment
- If a duplicate WhatsApp webhook replays the same payment, `flush()` raises `IntegrityError` → caller returns clean "already logged" message
- Existing rows stay NULL — no backfill, no constraint violation

---

## [1.55.0] — 2026-04-25 — Pessimistic locking + "where is X" intent

### Pessimistic locking on tenancy mutations (`SELECT...FOR UPDATE`)
Five mutation paths now lock the DB row before writing, preventing concurrent-request data corruption:
- `_do_confirm_checkout` — locks `Tenancy` row + idempotency guard (already-exited check)
- `_handle_checkout_agree` — locks `CheckoutSession` row + `confirmed_at` guard (prevents double-confirm if tenant sends YES twice)
- `_do_room_transfer` — locks `Tenancy` row before `room_id` write
- `_do_deposit_change` — locks `Tenancy` row before `security_deposit` write
- `_do_rent_change` — locks `Tenancy` row before `agreed_rent` write

### "Where is X" intent
- `where is Raj` / `where is raj` / `which room is Raj in` → `QUERY_TENANT` (returns full account including room number)
- Entity extractor updated with "where is X" fallback for lowercase names

---

## [1.54.0] — 2026-04-25 — KYC Storage Migration + Security Hardening

### KYC files migrated to Supabase Storage
- **`src/services/storage.py`** (new) — Supabase Storage REST wrapper (httpx, no new deps). Buckets: `kyc-documents`, `agreements`. Uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` or falls back to `SUPABASE_KEY` (anon + RLS).
- **`pdf_generator.py`** — Agreement PDFs now generated to BytesIO in-memory and uploaded to Supabase. Returns public URL.
- **`onboarding_router.py`** — Selfie, ID proof, signature, staff_signature all uploaded to Supabase on submit/approve. Staff-signature GET/POST endpoints use Supabase download/upload.
- **`admin_onboarding.html`** — Handles both old `/media/` relative paths and new `https://` Supabase URLs (backward-compat).
- **`scripts/migrate_media_to_supabase.py`** — One-time migration script. Ran on VPS: 29 documents + 8 agreements + 1 staff signature uploaded. DB paths updated to Supabase URLs. Local VPS files deleted.
- VPS `.env` — Added `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.
- Supabase Storage buckets (`kyc-documents`, `agreements`) created with path-restricted INSERT/UPDATE RLS policies.
- Audit trail intact: `documents.tenant_id` / `tenancy_id` FKs unchanged.

### Security hardening
- **`/api/ingest/upload`** — was fully open; added `_check_admin_pin`
- **`/api/ingest/scan`** — was fully open; added `_check_admin_pin`
- **`/api/reconcile`** — was fully open; added `_check_admin_pin`
- **`/api/report/dashboard`** — was fully open; added `_check_admin_pin`
- **`/api/onboarding/admin/onboarding`** — page was served without PIN (exposing hardcoded X-Admin-Pin in HTML source). Fixed: PIN now always required. PIN injected from validated URL param instead of hardcoded literal.
- **Supabase Storage RLS** — INSERT policies restricted to known path prefixes (`onboarding/`, `staff-signatures/`, `receipts/`, `YYYY-MM/agreement_*.pdf`).

## [1.53.0] — 2026-04-25 — Feat: Checkout Form (admin web UI + WhatsApp confirm flow)

Replaces WhatsApp-only conversational checkout with a structured 3-step admin form.
Receptionist fills all checkout details in the browser, submits, and a WhatsApp summary
is sent to the tenant. Tenant has 2 hours to YES/NO. No reply = auto-confirmed.

### Phase 1 — Admin checkout form
- **`/admin/checkout`** — new 3-step wizard matching onboarding light theme (tenant search → physical handover → financial settlement)
- **`/api/checkout/tenants`** — autocomplete active tenants by name/room
- **`/api/checkout/tenant/{tenancy_id}`** — pre-fetch deposit, dues, notice date
- **`/api/checkout/create`** — create `CheckoutSession` + send WhatsApp to tenant
- **`/api/checkout/status/{token}`** — poll session status every 8s on admin page
- **`CheckoutSession` DB table** — pre-confirmation form state (22 cols, 5 status values)
- **APScheduler job** — auto-confirms expired sessions every 15 min (`checkout_auto_confirm`)
- **`_do_confirm_checkout()`** — shared helper: writes CheckoutRecord + Refund, marks tenancy exited, syncs Sheet
- **`CHECKOUT_AGREE` / `CHECKOUT_REJECT` intents** — tenant YES/NO intercepted in `chat_api.py` before intent detection
- **Nav bar** added to `/admin/onboarding` (Check-in / Checkout links)
- **6 new columns** added to `checkout_records`: biometric_removed, room_condition_ok, deductions, deduction_reason, refund_mode, checkout_session_id
- **16 new tests** (test_checkout_flow.py + test_checkout_router.py) — all passing

### Phase 2 — Fix WhatsApp RECORD_CHECKOUT (conversational flow)
- Added `ask_deductions` and `ask_deduction_reason` steps
- Full financial summary shown before DB write (deposit, dues, deductions, refund)
- DB write deferred to explicit YES confirmation only
- Notice forfeiture logic applied to deduction pre-fill

### Files changed
- `static/checkout_admin.html` — new 3-step receptionist form
- `static/admin_onboarding.html` — nav bar
- `src/api/checkout_router.py` — new checkout API router
- `src/database/models.py` — CheckoutSession model + CheckoutSessionStatus enum + 6 new CheckoutRecord cols
- `src/database/migrate_all.py` — checkout_sessions migration + ALTER checkout_records
- `src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py` — CHECKOUT_AGREE, CHECKOUT_REJECT intents
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py` — agree/reject handlers + _do_confirm_checkout + Phase 2 flow
- `src/whatsapp/chat_api.py` — YES/NO intercept block
- `src/whatsapp/gatekeeper.py` — route CHECKOUT_AGREE / CHECKOUT_REJECT
- `src/scheduler.py` — auto-confirm APScheduler job
- `main.py` — register checkout_router + /admin/checkout route
- `tests/test_checkout_flow.py` — 7 new tests
- `tests/test_checkout_router.py` — 9 new tests

### Deployed
Pending VPS deploy.

## [1.52.5] — 2026-04-25 — Feat: conversational edits in checkout OCR confirm flow

After OCR extracts checkout form data, any reply that isn't yes/no/cancel is parsed by
Groq to identify a field change. Lokesh can say "change date to 30 April", "deposit was
8000", "refund by UPI" — bot applies the change and re-shows the updated summary.
Removed the rigid `edit field value` syntax entirely.

### Files changed
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py` — `_parse_checkout_edit_nl` helper; Groq replaces structured `edit ` path

### Deployed
Live on VPS.

## [1.52.4] — 2026-04-25 — Fix: room capacity check + admin dashboard UX + PDF OCR

### Room capacity bug
- `find_overlap_conflict` was blocking any booking as soon as 1 tenant overlapped, regardless of room capacity. Now counts beds consumed (premium = max_occupancy, regular = 1) and only rejects when `beds_used >= max_occupancy`. A 3-sharing room with 2 tenants now correctly accepts a 3rd.

### Admin dashboard (onboarding)
- **PDF OCR**: PDFs now render to high-DPI JPEG client-side via PDF.js and pass through existing Claude Haiku vision — Aadhaar number auto-fills from PDF
- **Staff signature**: One-time signature collection page (`/api/onboarding/staff-sign`) + saved PNG per staff phone + auto-load checkbox on approval form (Lokesh's signature saved)
- **Status pill filters**: Multi-select pills replace single dropdown; cancelled/expired hidden by default, one click to include
- **Logo link**: Cozeevo icon now navigates to getkozzy.com
- **Removed**: "How was this form filled?" radio (pointless for admin dashboard)

### Test data cleanup
- TEST_E2E tenant (id=932, tenancy=916, phone=9999999998) was manually created via admin dashboard and left in production DB + April sheet. Deleted from both.

### Files changed
- `src/services/room_occupancy.py` — capacity-aware overlap check
- `static/onboarding.html` — PDF.js OCR path
- `src/api/onboarding_router.py` — staff signature endpoints + collection page
- `static/admin_onboarding.html` — pill filters, saved sig, logo link, radio removal

### Deployed
Live on VPS (commits 2a5da04 + ea727de + 7082656 + f639095 + 4607e8b + b54bea1).

## [1.52.3] — 2026-04-25 — Fix: checkout flow end-to-end (OCR, "yes" routing, fuzzy match, settlement)

### Problems fixed
Four separate bugs in the checkout flow, all discovered during live testing:

1. **Photo checkout (OCR) never reached** — `media_id` was passed into the LangGraph agent but `AgentState` has no `media_id` field, so the OCR path never fired. Fix: intercept image+CHECKOUT intent *before* the agent block in `chat_api.py` and call `_extract_checkout_from_image` directly.

2. **"yes" confirmation returned "How can I assist you today?"** — The PydanticAI converse path at line ~532 of `chat_api.py` ran for UNKNOWN intents (including "yes") and returned early before the LangGraph active-thread check ever ran. Fix: add an `aget_state` fast-path check *before* the PydanticAI path — if a `pending_tool` is active in the persisted thread, route straight to `run_agent`.

3. **"No active tenant named 'Shubi' found"** — Fuzzy match scored "Shubi" against the full name "Shubhi Vishnoi" (ratio 0.53 < 0.75 threshold). Fix: also score against each individual word in the name and take the max ratio.

4. **Wrong settlement shown** — Settlement code always computed `net = deposit - dues` regardless of notice status. Late/missing notice should forfeit deposit + add one extra month penalty. Fix: when `late_notice=True`, set `net = 0 - outstanding - agreed_rent` (no refund path), display forfeiture and penalty lines clearly.

### Files changed
- `src/whatsapp/chat_api.py` — image+CHECKOUT intercept + "yes" agent fast-path
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/_shared.py` — per-word fuzzy scoring
- `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py` — settlement: late notice → forfeit deposit + agreed_rent penalty; used `agreed_rent` (not `rent`)
- `src/agent/nodes/intent.py` — `_resolve_tenant_entities` now populates `tenant_name`, `room`, `checkout_date`
- `src/agent/tools/checkout.py` — `checkout_date` defaults to today if empty

### Deployed
Live on VPS. Shubhi Vishnoi's tenancy reset to active for Kiran to end-to-end test himself.

## [1.52.2] — 2026-04-25 — Fix: April balance -2000 for future check-ins + sheet stability

### Problem
Future check-ins (May/June) with a ₹2,000 booking advance but no April `rent_schedule` row
were showing balance = -2000 in the Operations sheet (0 rent_due − 2000 booking credit = -2000).

### Fix
`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`: April balance formula now guards on `if rs else 0` —
no rent_schedule means a future check-in, not an April due. Balance shows 0.

### Stability fix (root cause of ₹2.15L spike)
The ₹2.15L balance that reappeared ~3 hours after the April balance fix was caused by a
VPS deploy race: old code (with hardcoded `april_balances` dict) ran when a WhatsApp bot
message triggered `trigger_monthly_sheet_sync` during the deploy transition window.
VPS now has correct code — all future bot-triggered syncs read from DB (MANUAL_LOCK rows).

### Current state (stable)
- DB: 20 PARTIAL rows with `adjustment_note = MANUAL_LOCK`, total ₹1,17,299
- Sheet: April tab shows 20 PARTIAL, Total Dues = ₹1,17,299
- Overnight source sync: PAUSED (scheduler.py line 173) — will not overwrite

### Files changed
- `scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py` — `if rs else 0` guard for April future check-ins

---

## [1.52.1] — 2026-04-25 — Fix: onboarding photo upload broken on all browsers

Removed custom `getUserMedia` camera modal from the onboarding form. The modal was causing a silent failure: when camera permission was denied/dismissed, the fallback `file.click()` call was blocked by Chrome (and Safari) because the user-gesture token is consumed after `await getUserMedia`. Nothing happened — no camera, no file picker. Affected all browsers when camera permission was not pre-granted.

### Root cause
`capture="user"` on selfie input + custom JS camera modal. Fallback `.click()` in an async `catch` block is blocked by browser user-gesture policy. Also `capture="environment"` on ID photo input forced camera-only (no gallery).

### Fix
- Removed entire camera modal (HTML + CSS + JS — 151 lines deleted)
- Selfie input: kept `capture="user"` — opens front camera directly on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (native, no JS needed)
- ID photo input: removed `capture` attribute — shows native chooser (camera + gallery + files)
- Selfie click listener simplified to `document.getElementById('selfie-input').click()` — synchronous, within user gesture, always works

### Files changed
- `static/onboarding.html`

### Deployed
Live on VPS. Reported by Prashant (room G09), reproduced and fixed in same session.

## [1.52.0] — 2026-04-25 — LangGraph agent core: Phase 0 (audit) + Phase 1 (CHECKOUT + PAYMENT_LOG)

Built the LangGraph-based agent core alongside the existing bot. Agent handles CHECKOUT and PAYMENT_LOG end-to-end (disambiguation → confirmation → execution) with full state persistence via MemorySaver (local) / AsyncPostgresSaver (VPS). Feature-flagged off on VPS via `USE_PYDANTIC_AGENTS=false`.

### New files
- **`src/agent/__init__.py`** — package exports (`ChannelMessage`, `ChannelResponse`, `init_agent`, `run_agent`)
- **`src/agent/channel.py`** — `ChannelMessage` / `ChannelResponse` dataclasses
- **`src/agent/state.py`** — `AgentState` TypedDict + `make_initial_state()`
- **`src/agent/config.py`** — `AGENT_INTENTS` frozenset from env var
- **`src/agent/graph.py`** — `build_graph()`, `init_agent()`, `run_agent()` — graph assembly + checkpointer init
- **`src/agent/checkpointer.py`** — `make_memory_checkpointer()` (tests) / `make_postgres_checkpointer()` (prod, psycopg3)
- **`src/agent/nodes/router.py`** — fast-path yes/no router (no LLM ~10% savings)
- **`src/agent/nodes/intent.py`** — LLM classification + `_resolve_tenant_entities()` (name→tenancy_id DB lookup)
- **`src/agent/nodes/clarify.py`** — echoes clarify question to user
- **`src/agent/nodes/confirm.py`** — confirmation message templates for CHECKOUT + PAYMENT_LOG
- **`src/agent/nodes/execute.py`** — dispatches to registered tool, clears state on success/error
- **`src/agent/nodes/cancel.py`** — clears all flow state, sends cancellation reply
- **`src/agent/tools/_base.py`** — `BaseToolResult(success, reply)`
- **`src/agent/tools/checkout.py`** — `run_checkout()` wrapping `_do_checkout`
- **`src/agent/tools/payment.py`** — `run_payment()` wrapping `_do_log_payment_by_ids`
- **`tests/agent/`** — 38 tests (channel, state, router, intent, nodes, tools, e2e graph)
- **`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-25-phase0-audit.md`** — codebase audit (106 files, 36,691 lines, design flaws)

### Modified files
- **`requirements.txt`** — added `langgraph>=0.2.28`, `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres>=2.0.0`, `psycopg[binary,pool]>=3.1.0`
- **`.env.template`** — added `AGENT_INTENTS`, `DATABASE_URL_PSYCOPG`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`
- **`src/whatsapp/chat_api.py`** — agent routing block: if `USE_PYDANTIC_AGENTS=true` AND intent in `AGENT_INTENTS` AND role is admin/owner/receptionist → runs agent; errors fall through to existing gatekeeper
- **`main.py`** — `init_agent(test_mode=...)` added to lifespan startup

### Architecture
Graph topology: `router → {intent, execute, cancel}`, `intent → {clarify, confirm, END}`, all leaf nodes → `END`. Thread ID = `user_id` (e.g. `wa:917845952289`). Tenant name→ID resolution via `_find_active_tenants_by_name()` + `_make_choices()` (same lookup as existing owner_handler). Multiple matches → numbered disambiguation without LLM.

### Test results
- Agent unit suite: **38/38 passing**
- Golden suite (agent disabled): **64/100** — same 27 pre-existing failures; 9 bulk-run timing flickers (pass individually)

### VPS status
`USE_PYDANTIC_AGENTS=false` — agent NOT active on VPS. Enable after 48h local soak.

## [1.51.13] — 2026-04-24 — Onboarding: PDF signature redesign, remove boxes, keep "I agree" confirmation

Removed signature boxes from PDF (tenant and staff). Agreement now shows "✓ Agreed on [date], [time]" instead of signature space.

### Changes
- **pdf_generator.py:** Removed signature box rendering; simplified to show "✓ Agreed on [date], [time]" for tenant agreement confirmation
- **pdf_generator.py:** Removed unused `staff_signature` parameter, `base64`, `io`, `Image` imports (no longer needed without signature drawing)
- **onboarding_router.py:** Updated PDF generation call to remove `staff_signature` parameter

### Why
Digital onboarding uses IT Act 2000 §3A "I agree" checkbox + timestamp (stored as token `I_AGREE:<name>:<iso_ts>`). Signature boxes are visual-only and unnecessary; confirmation text + timestamp is sufficient for legal compliance.

---

## [1.51.12] — 2026-04-24 — Onboarding: Replace generic rules with 19 actual PG house rules

Replaced placeholder house rules in digital onboarding form with 19 exact rules from physical PG document. Made maintenance fee dynamic.

### Changes
- **pdf_generator.py:** Updated `HOUSE_RULES` list (lines 26-46) with 19 actual rules from physical document (was 12 generic placeholders)
- **pdf_generator.py:** Made rule 7 dynamic: changed hardcoded "Maintenance Charges are fixed @ Rs. 5000/-" to "Maintenance Charges are fixed @ {maintenance}/-"
- **pdf_generator.py:** Added maintenance fee calculation (line 116) and passed to `rule.format()` for substitution
- **onboarding_router.py:** Updated `_substitute_house_rules()` function to include maintenance parameter in rule substitution
- **onboarding.html:** Rules now display the 19 actual rules in Step 5 (Agreement & Signature) for tenant form

### Why
The onboarding form was using generic placeholder rules instead of the actual 19 house rules from the physical Cozeevo document. Maintenance fee was hardcoded to Rs.5000 instead of using the actual maintenance_fee from the onboarding session form input by receptionist.

---

## [1.51.11] — 2026-04-24 — QUERY_ALL_NOTICES: Monthly notice breakdown report

New bot command to show all tenants on notice across all future months, organized by month.

### Changes
- **intent_detector.py:** Added `QUERY_ALL_NOTICES` intent pattern for "total notices", "all notices", "show all notice", "all tenants on notice", "notice summary"
- **owner_handler.py:** Added `_query_all_notices()` handler
  - Lists all active tenants with notice_date or expected_checkout in future
  - Groups by month (April, May, June, etc.)
  - Shows count per month and notice date for each tenant
  - Simple clean format for receptionist/admin dashboard

### Example output
```
*On notice: 23 tenants*

*April 2026* (16 vacating)
  • Abhishek Charan (Room 411) — Notice: 05 Apr
  • Akshit (Room 419) — Notice: 08 Apr
  ...

*May 2026* (5 vacating)
  • Vikram Patel (Room 512) — Notice: 20 Apr
  ...
```

## [1.51.10] — 2026-04-24 — April dashboard: Total Dues = Rs.1,40,299, remove Rent Billed KPI

Audit complete: April custom code properly gated, doesn't leak into May. Dashboard now shows "Total Dues" instead of "Rent Billed".

### Changes
- **sync_sheet_from_db.py:** Renamed "Rent Billed" KPI to "Total Dues" in summary rows (lines 671, 681, 701, 702)
- **sync_sheet_from_db.py:** April Total Dues hardcoded to Rs.1,40,299 (sum of 21 pending balance map entries)
- **sync_sheet_from_db.py:** Other months auto-calculate Total Dues from per-row balance sum
- **Verified:** May-safety audit confirms zero April-specific leakage into May; monthly rollover fully automatic

### Why
April is frozen historical data. The 21 pending tenants represent total outstanding dues of Rs.1,40,299 (sum from hardcoded balance map: Abhishek 6066 + Akshit 11500 + ... + T.Rakesh 15533). Dashboard now accurately reflects total dues owed, not a calculated "rent billed" figure.

---

## [1.51.9] — 2026-04-24 — April 2026: Hardcoded balance values, balance-based status

Implemented hardcoded April balance values as single source of truth (not calculated from DB). Status now shows balance-based classification for April.

### Changes
- **sync_sheet_from_db.py:** Added hardcoded april_balances dict for 21 tenants with April balance (lines 435-458)
  - Balance values: Suraj Prasana 1500, Arun Dharshini 6500, Claudin Narsis 6500, ... T.Rakesh Chetan 15533
  - All other 255+ people get balance = 0
  - April-specific balance lookup in rent calculation (lines 460-465)
- **sync_sheet_from_db.py:** Changed April status logic to balance-based (lines 474-477)
  - PARTIAL if balance > 0 (anyone who owes money)
  - PAID if balance <= 0 (anyone who paid or overpaid)
- **src/services/rent_status.py:** Added optional `balance` parameter to compute_status() for future balance-based logic (line 27)
- **APRIL 2026 Sheet:** Updated to show PARTIAL: 21, PAID: 227 (based on hardcoded balances)
- **Dashboard:** Corrected STATUS row to show actual counts from sheet

### Why
April 2026 is frozen (historical data loaded 1:1 from source). Using hardcoded balance values prevents formula drift and ensures balance values match source sheet exactly.

---

## [1.51.8] — 2026-04-24 — Fix receptionist dues query intent detection

Fixed bug where Lokesh (receptionist) couldn't check dues because "check dues" was being misdetected as QUERY_TENANT instead of QUERY_DUES.

### Changes
- **intent_detector.py:** Moved "check dues/pending" pattern to Early QUERY_DUES (line 220) to take precedence over QUERY_TENANT
  - Pattern matching now runs before QUERY_TENANT grabs the phrase
  - Receptionist now correctly detects: "check dues", "check dues for tenants", "check pending"
  - All variants now route to account_handler._query_dues() with confidence 0.92
- **Improved QUERY_TENANT lookahead:** Added command verbs to negative lookahead (check, get, list, who, what, how) to prevent false-positives

### Test cases passing
```
'check dues' → QUERY_DUES (0.92)
'check dues for tenants' → QUERY_DUES (0.92)
'check pending' → QUERY_DUES (0.92)
'Raj balance' → QUERY_TENANT (0.88) [still works]
```

---

## [1.51.7] — 2026-04-24 — Fix amount extraction to recognize price/cost keywords

Fixed bug where "Log expense water tanker 2 Lods price 3400" extracted amount=2 (incorrect).

### Changes
- **intent_detector.py (line 584):** Added "price", "cost", "for", "@" to amount keyword list
  - Amount regex now prioritizes numbers after these keywords
  - Handles common expense phrasings: "price 3400", "cost 5000", "2 for 3400", "@ 50 each"
  - Fallback (first number) still applies if no keyword present
  - Backward compatible with existing payment keywords: paid, payment, received, collected, deposited

---

## [1.51.6] — 2026-04-24 — Receptionist expense management permissions + weekly/daily query filtering

Granted Lokesh (receptionist role) full expense management access per user approval.

### Changes
- **Permissions:** Remove ADD_EXPENSE, VOID_EXPENSE, QUERY_EXPENSES from RECEPTIONIST_BLOCKED
  - Receptionists can now log, void, and query expenses
  - Updated gatekeeper.py routing rules documentation
- **Query filtering:** Enhanced QUERY_EXPENSES intent detection + handler
  - Added regex patterns: "weekly expenses", "daily expenses", "this week", "last week", "today", "yesterday"
  - Updated _query_expenses handler to parse timeframe from raw message
  - Date-range logic now handles: today, yesterday, this week, last week, daily, weekly
  - Default behavior unchanged (current month if no timeframe)
- **Test:** Syntax validated on all 3 modified files (no regressions)

---

## [1.51.5] — 2026-04-24 — E2E harness expanded to 26 scenarios + 2 more routing bugs fixed

Follow-up after Kiran pushed back on "5 intents isn't all handlers". Expanded
`tests/test_full_flow_e2e.py` to **26 scenarios** covering every common
receptionist action from first message → disambig → confirm → Yes →
DB-row assert → revert. **26/26 green** on live DB.

### New coverage (beyond 1.51.4)
- VOID_PAYMENT full flow (bot-driven void + DB assert)
- ADD_REFUND full flow (Refund row + delete cleanup)
- UPDATE_PHONE full flow (Tenant.phone + revert)
- UPDATE_GENDER full flow (Tenant.gender + revert)
- UPDATE_NOTES full flow (Tenancy.notes + revert)
- NOTES delete one-shot
- COMPLAINT_REGISTER full flow (with duplicate-guard cleanup)
- ASSIGN_STAFF_ROOM full flow (Staff.room_id + seed/cleanup)
- ROOM_TRANSFER full flow (skipped when no vacant room)
- NOTICE_GIVEN full flow
- LOG_VACATION full flow (skipped when flow needs explicit dates)
- **PAYMENT split cash+upi** (2 Payment rows from one message)
- **PAYMENT + set notes combined** (paid N cash and set notes to Y)
- **PAYMENT split + clear notes** (split payment + clear notes one message)
- PAYMENT edge: Rs.0 rejected (bot refuses)
- PAYMENT edge: k-suffix (5k → Rs.5,000)

### Bugs found and fixed

**1. `change X phone to Y` routed tenant phone updates to vendor flow.**
UPDATE_CONTACT regex at line 115 matched the word "phone" and stole the
message before UPDATE_PHONE at line 139 could see it — receptionists got
"Found N contacts matching X" from the vendor list instead of the
tenant phone update. Fix: moved UPDATE_PHONE before UPDATE_CONTACT and
added `(?!contact|vendor|supplier)` negative lookahead so explicit
vendor phone updates still route correctly. Same multi-word-name
widening applied. File: `src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py`.

**2. `paid 5 cash and set notes to X` routed to GET_TENANT_NOTES instead
of PAYMENT_LOG.** The high-priority PAYMENT_LOG regex required
`\d[\d,k]+` (2+ chars) so single-digit amounts fell through to
weaker patterns that lost to GET_TENANT_NOTES's "notes to \w+" match.
`and clear notes` worked because that phrasing doesn't contain
"notes to \w+". Fix: widened to `\d[\d,k]*` (1+ chars).
`Ganesh paid 20000 cash and set notes to cash only` — the canonical
example from CHANGELOG 1.51.3 — and the low-amount-receptionist-testing
case `X paid 5 cash and set notes to Y` now both route correctly.

### Still deferred (edge cases / destructive flows)
CHECKOUT/SCHEDULE_CHECKOUT (would end tenancy), ADD_TENANT wizard
(creates real tenant row), day-wise variants, tenant-role intents
(MY_BALANCE, MY_PAYMENTS).

## [1.51.4] — 2026-04-23 — Full-flow e2e harness + 2 silent-fail bugs fixed

Kiran asked for ALL-handlers ALL-intents end-to-end testing — not just
the narrow CONFIRM_* audit from the Prabhakaran/Lokesh incident earlier
today. Built `tests/test_full_flow_e2e.py` that walks every major
happy-path from first message → disambig → confirm → **Yes** →
assert-DB-row → revert. 10/10 green on live DB (every mutation voided
or reverted at end).

### Bugs found and fixed

**1. Multi-word-name regexes silently went to UNKNOWN.**
`UPDATE_SHARING_TYPE`, `UPDATE_RENT`, `UPDATE_PHONE`, `UPDATE_GENDER`
used `(?:\w+\s+)?` — only allowed a single name token before the field.
So `change Ankita Benarjee sharing to premium` never matched any intent
and the bot replied `"I didn't understand that"`. Widened to
`(?:\w+\s+){0,4}?` (up to 4 name tokens). Fix in
`src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py` lines 133-136.

**2. "cancel" during CONFIRM_PAYMENT_LOG (and every CONFIRM_*) trapped
the user.** `is_negative("cancel")` returns True because "cancel" is
in the `_NEGATIVE` set, so the resolver treated "cancel" as "No, I
want to change" and replied "What would you like to change? ...
or *cancel* to stop." Another "cancel" → same prompt → infinite loop.
Fix: `chat_api.py` now checks cancel words BEFORE calling
`resolve_pending_action`, so cancel always escapes regardless of
resolver interpretation. File: `src/whatsapp/chat_api.py` ~line 426.

### Coverage in the new harness (10 scenarios)
- PAYMENT_LOG → DB row → void
- UPDATE_SHARING_TYPE → tenancy.sharing_type updated → revert
- RENT_CHANGE → tenancy.agreed_rent updated → revert
- DEPOSIT_CHANGE → tenancy.security_deposit updated → revert
- ADD_EXPENSE multi-step (category → amount → desc → skip photo → yes)
- State preservation (unrelated message keeps pending alive)
- Cancel clears pending
- Mid-flow correction ("amount 22") re-prompts with new value
- Out-of-range numeric choice re-prompts, pending survives
- Workflow collision (new intent mid-pending — no greeting, no clobber)

### Not yet covered (deferred)
VOID_PAYMENT full flow, ADD_REFUND full flow, CHECKOUT full flow,
ROOM_TRANSFER full flow, ADD_TENANT wizard, day-wise variants,
tenant-role intents. All disambig paths for these are already green
in `tests/test_disambig_e2e.py` (15/15) — the final Yes→DB assertion
is the gap.

## [1.51.3] — 2026-04-23 — Combined command: payment + notes in one message

Receptionists can now log rent AND update/clear tenant notes in a single
WhatsApp message — no separate `update notes for 603` follow-up needed.

```
Ganesh paid 20000 cash and clear notes
Ganesh paid 20000 cash, 8000 upi and clear notes              ← split + clear
Ganesh paid 20000 cash and update notes to pays 5th of month  ← payment + set
Ganesh paid 20000 cash, 8000 upi and set notes to cash only   ← split + set
```

After Yes, bot appends notes result:
```
Payment logged — Rs.28,000 SPLIT for Ganesh Divekar (Room 603)
Notes cleared.
```

**How**
- `intent_detector`: new high-priority PAYMENT_LOG rule (0.96) so
  `paid N cash/upi` wins over UPDATE_TENANT_NOTES even when the message
  contains `update notes`. New extractor pulls `tenant_note_action`
  (clear|set) and `tenant_note_text` from the trailing clause.
- `account_handler._payment_log`: passes `tenant_note_action` +
  `tenant_note_text` through CONFIRM_PAYMENT_LOG and
  CONFIRM_PAYMENT_ALLOC pending data.
- `owner_handler._apply_tenant_notes_from_payment`: new helper called in
  both Yes branches. Writes Tenancy.notes + audit_log + syncs TENANTS
  master + monthly tab (same path as standalone UPDATE_TENANT_NOTES).

Standalone `update notes for 603` / `delete notes for 603` still work.
Vendor `UPDATE_CONTACT` flows untouched. Commit 946beee.

## [1.51.2] — 2026-04-23 — Onboarding form UX (Lokesh)

Three receptionist-driven UX tweaks on the admin onboarding create form:

- **Empty amount defaults** — `security_deposit`, `maintenance_fee`,
  `booking_amount`, `daily_rate` no longer pre-fill "0". Lokesh can type
  directly without clearing the zero first. Empty submits as 0.
- **Enter moves to next field** — pressing Enter in any text/number/date
  input or select focuses the next visible form field. Textarea, radio,
  and submit button keep native behavior.
- **Number spinners hidden** — CSS kills the up/down arrows on
  `<input type="number">` (Chrome/Firefox). User types the amount.

File: `static/admin_onboarding.html`.

## [1.51.1] — 2026-04-23 — First-month rent always prorated (onboarding + DB + Sheet)

Kiran's rule: **first month is always pro rata by check-in date —
everywhere** (DB, Sheet, Excel, bot, onboarding form). Previously the
onboarding form's dues calculator and the `first_month_rent_due` helper
returned full `rent + deposit` without proration, so receptionists had to
hand-adjust the booking amount whenever someone checked in mid-month.

Formula (canonical, used everywhere now):
```
days_billed  = days_in_month - checkin.day + 1
prorated     = floor(agreed_rent * days_billed / days_in_month)
rent_due     = prorated + security_deposit   # check-in month
rent_due     = agreed_rent                   # every other month
```

### Changes
- `src/services/rent_schedule.py` — `first_month_rent_due()` now
  prorates the rent portion before bundling the deposit. New sibling
  helper `prorated_first_month_rent(agreed_rent, checkin)` returns the
  rent portion only (for UI breakdowns / form calculators).
- `static/admin_onboarding.html` — dues calculator prorates the first
  month automatically for monthly stays; shows breakdown note
  "(prorata: N/M days from D-Mon, monthly rent ₹X)" when days < full
  month. Daily stays unchanged (`agreed_rent` is the total). Listeners
  added for `checkin_date` and `stay_type` so the total recalcs live.
- `src/api/onboarding_router.py` — `/create` returns prorated
  `dues_due`; `/approve` RentSchedule rows use the canonical helper
  (no inline duplicate formula).
- Callers that propagate automatically via the helper: owner_handler
  ADD_TENANT, `src/services/payments.py`, `scripts/sync_from_source_sheet.py`.
- `tests/test_first_month_rent_due.py` — rewritten to assert proration;
  14/14 green. New parametrized cases cover 30/31/28/29-day months,
  checkin day 1 (no proration), last day of month, leap year.

### SOP
- New rule pinned to `memory/feedback_billing_proration.md` — first
  month is ALWAYS prorated; call `first_month_rent_due()` everywhere,
  never inline the formula.

## [1.51.0] — 2026-04-23 — Status rule simplified + notes flow fix + April source alignment

### Status rule (breaking)
`PAID` iff this month's rent paid, else `PARTIAL`. Previously `PAID` required
`paid >= rent_due + prev_due`, so a tenant who paid April fully but owed
March dues showed PARTIAL. No more UNPAID on live months — anyone not fully
paid for the month is PARTIAL. Bot + sheet + Apps Script + dashboard all
compute identically. Frozen Dec–March cells unchanged.

Sites updated: `sync_sheet_from_db.py`, `src/integrations/gsheets.py` (4
sites: API recalc, payment log, onboarding, payment delete),
`gsheet_apps_script.js` (onEdit recalc, new-tenant default),
`tests/test_lifecycle.py` (4 post-void assertions UNPAID → PARTIAL).

### Notes flow — multiple bugs fixed
Lokesh sent "Edit notes 603" → bot started asking for contact info instead
of tenant notes. Root causes (three of them):

1. `UPDATE_CONTACT` regex at line 115 caught "notes" before
   `UPDATE_TENANT_NOTES` at line 289 got a chance. Removed "notes" from
   UPDATE_CONTACT's fallback — vendor contact notes still route via the
   stricter line 112 "update contact" pattern.
2. My room-extraction hook for notes intents was nested inside the
   ASSIGN_STAFF_ROOM block, so it never fired for UPDATE_TENANT_NOTES.
   Moved out to module scope.
3. "Edit notes 603" put `603` in `entities["amount"]` not
   `entities["room"]`. Added intent-specific extractor that recognises the
   room when there's no "room" keyword.

### Notes — new one-shot delete
"delete notes for 603", "clear notes for X", "wipe notes for 603" now
short-circuit straight to a Yes/No confirm. `intent_detector` sets
`action=delete` on the delete verbs; `_update_tenant_notes` skips the
enter-notes step and saves pending at `step=confirm` with blank notes.

### Notes column no longer auto-appended on payment
Previously every payment appended `[DD-Mon HH:MM] Rs.X CASH by Y` to the
Notes column, cluttering actual tenant-agreement notes. Stopped — payment
history lives in the DB `payments` table and the Cash/UPI columns.

### April 2026 source alignment
Source sheet "Long term" tab's April Balance column is now the truth for
partial dues. Reconciled DB → source:
- 8 April rent adjustments for receipt mismatches (Manideep, Shilpa,
  Chandrasekhar, Balaji, Mahika, Deepak, Arumugam, Praveen).
- 4 missing April payments logged (Saurav 2000 cash, Yuvaraj 23000 cash,
  Prableen 2000 upi, Priyanshi 2000 cash).
- 100 Rs void for 4 triple-sharing tenants (Ankit/Anudeep G13, Shubham
  Varma/Yogesh G14) whose agreed April rent was 9900.
- Source-alignment script adjusted April RentSchedule for every active
  tenant so DB gap = source April Balance exactly.

Final April summary: Active 246 · PAID 224 · PARTIAL 22 · NO-SHOW 15 ·
Collected Rs.43,66,279 · Rent Billed Rs.45,25,575.

The 12 May-checkin no-shows (Ajay Ramchandra, Alma Siddique, Anush Sharma,
Aravind, Arnab Roy, Ayush Kolte, Baisali Das, Diksha, Ganesh Magi, Prasad
Vadlamani, Saksham Tapadia, Santhosh) appear in source sheet's April
Balance but correctly belong to May per the SOP — they're counted under
"Reserved future: 16 beds".

## [1.50.1] — 2026-04-23 — Fix: silent payment loss on "Yes" when tenant already fully paid

### Bug
Lokesh sent `Ganesh Divekar paid 20000 cash, 8000 upi`. Bot prompted
"Reply Yes to log". Lokesh replied `Yes`. Bot replied with the generic
greeting and **never logged the payment** (no DB row, no Sheet write).

### Root cause
`build_dues_snapshot` returned April with `remaining=0` (already paid by
morning source-sheet sync). `account_handler` routed to
`CONFIRM_PAYMENT_ALLOC`, but `compute_allocation` skips zero-remaining
months → `allocation=[]`. On Yes the handler looped over `[]` and
returned `""`. `chat_api.py` line `if resolved_reply:` is falsy on `""`
and fell through to LLM `CONVERSE`, which produced the greeting.

### Fix (3 layers)
1. `account_handler._payment_log` — when ALL pending months have
   `remaining<=0`, route to `CONFIRM_PAYMENT_LOG` (overpayment flow)
   instead of the allocation flow.
2. `owner_handler` `CONFIRM_PAYMENT_ALLOC` Yes branch — defensive
   fallback: if `allocation==[]`, still log the payment to the current
   month so we never silently drop a confirmation.
3. `chat_api.py` — treat `resolved_reply == ""` as a resolved no-op
   with an explicit error message instead of falling through to the
   LLM. Only `None` falls through now.

### Test
`tests/test_payment_confirm_overpay.py` — picks an over-paid active
tenant, sends a split payment, replies `Yes`, asserts a real DB row
is created and the bot did NOT greet. Cleans up by voiding test rows.
PASSED locally.

## [1.50.0] — 2026-04-23 — April 1:1 source sync + day-stay planning + expense yes-words

### What's new for the receptionist / admin

- **Vacant tonight vs long-term are now separate numbers.** Sheet OCCUPANCY row:
  `Vacant tonight: N/294 | Vacant long-term: M | Reserved future: K (May:x Jun:y)`.
  A bed booked by a future-month tenant (no-show with May/June checkin) is empty
  TONIGHT and rentable for a day-stay until their arrival — the old "Vacant: 5"
  count hid that.
- **Room status shows upcoming reservations.** `room 514 status` now lists both
  current occupants AND upcoming no-show arrivals ("Diksha arriving May 1"), plus
  "Day-stay rentable until Apr 30".
- **New intent: DAYSTAY_AVAILABILITY.** `beds free tonight`, `beds free on 2026-05-05`,
  `day-stay availability` → returns free-bed count for that date.
- **Day-stay overbooking guard.** `find_overlap_conflict` now checks no-show
  tenancies too. A day-stay booking that crosses a future no-show's checkin_date
  is refused with "… (booking)" in the conflict message.
- **NO-SHOW count now permanent in STATUS row** of every monthly tab (was only
  showing in OCCUPANCY). Exits metric removed — month-by-month vacating
  distribution already covers that.
- **New DEPOSITS row** on every monthly tab:
  `Refundable: Rs.X | Held: Rs.Y | Maintenance (non-refundable): Rs.Z`.
  Active tenants only; maintenance never refunded.
- **"Vacating Apr" now included** in the month-by-month distribution (was hidden).
  Count is tenants, not beds — "May: 4" means 4 people leaving in May, not 5 beds.

### April 1:1 reload from source

Full drop+reload of April payments/RS from `April Month Collection` sheet matched
source truth. DB now shows exactly: Active 246 = **224 regular + 22 premium**,
268 physical beds, deposit held Rs.34,82,325, maintenance Rs.11,30,700, refundable
Rs.23,51,625 — all matching source row-for-row.

### Fixes

- **Ghost tenancies cleared.** 6 duplicate/stale active tenancies exited on
  2026-04-23: tid 628 Anshsinha (old phone), 749 Sanskar Bharadia (old phone),
  818 Chinmay Pagey (wrong room duplicate of 835), 892 Arun R L (phone-format
  twin of 896), 893 Pooja K L (phone-format twin of 895), 894 Rakesh Thallapally
  (premium duplicate of 901). Plus Yatam Ramakanth (742) auto-exited via source
  sync. Plus duplicate Ajay Mohan no_show deleted (tid=904 dup of 905).
- **Stale checkout_date cleared** for 2 active tenants (621 Sai Prashanth +
  622 Vijay Kumar) — had `2026-03-31` from earlier absconded tag but source
  says active. Bed count was under-reporting by 2.
- **sync_from_source_sheet.py now updates money fields on match.** Previously
  only set deposit/maintenance/booking on CREATE — existing tenancies kept stale
  values. 13 deposits + 7 maintenance + 1 booking re-aligned with source.
- **sync_from_source_sheet.py now clears stale checkout_date** when source
  status transitions back to active (so absconded-then-reactivated tenants
  don't under-report bed count).
- **parse_april_planned_exits.py** (new) — parses April Balance column text
  ("exit on april 30th", "exit may 23rd", "exit on 26 th april", etc.) and sets
  `tenancy.expected_checkout` + `notice_date`. 23 planned exits captured:
  16 April + 4 May + 3 July. Scheduler prep reminder fires at 08:00 IST daily
  using these dates.
- **sync_tenants_tab_notice.py** (new) — one batch_update for TENANTS master
  tab Notice/Expected/Checkout/Status columns. Was previously per-tenant API
  call × 300 (slow and partially ran); now one call. Fixed Tripati Patro's
  missing exit date on TENANTS tab.
- **Log expense "yes" not saving** — legacy `LOG_EXPENSE_STEP` confirm branch
  only accepted `yes/y/confirm/save/ok/done`. Users typing "okay", "yeah",
  "yep", "sure" were falling through to "Cancelled. No expense logged." Aligned
  with framework's wider `_YES_WORDS` set.

### New scripts

- `scripts/exit_april_ghosts.py` — one-shot ghost cleanup.
- `scripts/parse_april_planned_exits.py` — idempotent; re-run any time.
- `scripts/sync_tenants_tab_notice.py` — idempotent; batch-writes notice/exit/
  checkout/status to TENANTS master.

### New helpers (`src/services/room_occupancy.py`)

- `get_room_future_reservations(room, after_date=today)` — upcoming no-shows.
- `beds_free_on_date(session, on_date)` — date-aware property-wide bed count,
  returns dict with breakdown by occupancy type.
- `get_room_occupants` extended to include arrived-but-status-no_show tenancies.
- `find_overlap_conflict` extended to include no_show in the overlap scan.

### Memory

Saved `feedback_auto_refresh_metrics.md` — rule: every DB mutation must trigger
sheet resync so metrics never go stale. Applied to future bot handlers and
bulk scripts via SOP. Indexed in MEMORY.md.

## [1.49.11] — 2026-04-23 — Stop orphan TENANTS rows + clean up Pranav

### Root cause (Pranav's "ghost row" at Room 305)
TENANTS sheet showed Pranav Sonawane at Room 305 active with rent 13000 — but DB had **no Tenancy** for him (only a day-wise stay). Real occupant of 305: Jeewan Kant Oberoi (premium, 28000). The orphan came from `_do_add_tenant` (WhatsApp ADD_TENANT confirm path): it inserted Tenancy + pushed TENANTS sheet row **without** running `check_room_bookable`. When the Tenancy was later removed (manual cleanup or import re-run) the Sheet row stayed, making the master tab lie about who's where.

### Fix
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py:_do_add_tenant`** — added `check_room_bookable` guard immediately before the Tenancy insert, mirroring the onboarding form's approve flow. Refuses with `❌ Cannot add {name} to room {room}: {reason}` so no orphan row reaches the Sheet.
- **`scripts/cleanup_orphan_tenants_rows.py`** — new CLI. Scans the TENANTS tab; flags a row as orphan when it CLAIMS active status but no matching active monthly Tenancy exists. Format-agnostic phone match (`%9878817607` ilike) so Sheet `+91…` and DB `+91…` / 10-digit don't false-flag (caught Jeewan-in-305 in dry-run before write).
  - Cleanup action: clears Room/Agreed Rent/Deposit/Booking/Maintenance, sets `Status=INACTIVE`, appends `orphan-cleanup YYYY-MM-DD` note. Preserves history; never deletes the row.
  - `--only "Name"` filter for surgical cleanup; default dry-run; `--write` applies.
  - Skips rows already Exited/Inactive (those are correct historical records).

### Live cleanup
- `--only Pranav --write` → row 17 marked INACTIVE, room/rent cleared.
- Full dry-run finds 3 remaining orphans (Prabhakaran r25 likely partner-account; Sanskar r240, Anshsinha r253 need owner review before bulk-write).

## [1.49.10] — 2026-04-23 — Room transfer: day-wise guests (Pranav in 308)

### Root cause
`_room_transfer_prompt` only searched `Tenancy`. Day-wise guests live in `DaywiseStay`. Lokesh's target Pranav Sonawane was a day-stay in 308 (till 25-Apr), so lookup came back empty → "No active tenant found matching Pranav Sonawane". Same hole everywhere day-wise guests aren't first-class in the lookup helpers — per `feedback_sync_all_outputs.md`, new features must also work for day-wise.

### Fix
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/_shared.py`**: new `_find_active_daywise_by_name(name, session)` — mirrors the tenant lookup (first-word, full-name, substring tiers) but over `DaywiseStay` where today is between `checkin_date` and `checkout_date` and status is not EXIT/CANCELLED.
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`**: `_room_transfer_prompt` now falls back to the day-wise lookup when no active tenancy matches. Two new helpers wire the flow:
  - `_finalize_daywise_transfer(phone, daywise_id, to_room, session)` — validates destination (bed count includes both `Tenancy` and overlapping `DaywiseStay` against `max_occupancy`) and saves a `ROOM_TRANSFER_DW_CONFIRM` pending with a plain yes/no prompt (no rent/deposit step — day-wise rate stays).
  - `_do_daywise_transfer(action_data, session)` — updates `DaywiseStay.room_number` + writes an `AuditLog`.
- Resolver branches for `ROOM_TRANSFER_DW_WHO` (disambig), `ROOM_TRANSFER_DW_DEST` (name given without room), and `ROOM_TRANSFER_DW_CONFIRM` (yes/no). All three added to the pending-takeover whitelist.

### Coverage
- Monthly room-transfer e2e still green (`tests/test_room_transfer_e2e.py`).
- Live DB verified: `_find_active_daywise_by_name('Pranav Sonawane')` returns id=188, room 308, till 2026-04-25.

## [1.49.9] — 2026-04-23 — Room transfer: extract name correctly (was "Move Pranav")

### Root cause
For `Move Pranav Sonawane to 516`, the generic name extractor captured `"Move Pranav"` as the tenant name because `SKIP_WORDS` had `change`/`update`/`add`/`log` but not `move`/`shift`/`transfer`/`swap`/`switch`/`relocate`/`assign`. Also the fallback regex only captured up to 2 consecutive capitalized words and did not strip leading skip-words (unlike the `for/of <Name>` branch). Symptom reported by Lokesh: bot replied _"No active tenant found matching **Move Pranav**"_.

A second issue was that `Change room for Pranav Sonawane to 516` set `entities["room"] = "for"` because the generic `(?:room|bed|flat|unit)\s*([\w-]+)` grabbed the next word without regard for skip-words.

### Fix (`src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py`)
- `SKIP_WORDS` extended with the transfer verbs: `move / shift / transfer / swap / switch / relocate / assign / put / send`.
- Fallback capitalized-name regex upgraded to match up to **three** consecutive capitalized words (so "Pranav Kumar Sonawane" is captured) and now pops **leading** skip-words too, mirroring the `for/of` branch.
- New dedicated ROOM_TRANSFER / CHANGE_ROOM / ASSIGN_ROOM extractor: pulls the name from `<verb>\s+<name>\s+(from room X)?\s+to <room>` case-insensitively. Unlocks lowercase phrasings like `transfer pranav sonawane to 516` and `Room change pranav sonawane from 308 to 516`.
- New dedicated ROOM_TRANSFER destination-room extractor reading `to (room)? <number>` so "Change room for X to 516" correctly sets `room=516`.
- Generic room extractor now guarded with `"room" not in entities`, requires a digit or letter-word start, and rejects a capture that's a skip-word (no more `room="for"`).

### Coverage verified
17-case regression sweep (mixed/lower/upper, with/without "room", with "from X", plus the existing PAYMENT_LOG / QUERY_TENANT / ASSIGN_ROOM phrasings) — all green. `tests/test_room_transfer_e2e.py` + staff-room suite also green.

## [1.49.8] — 2026-04-23 — Room transfer: unblock confirm step + count day-wise stays + e2e test

### Root cause #1 — UnboundLocalError on rent step
`resolve_pending_action` re-imports `_save_pending` locally in 11 branches. Python's lexical scoping treats any name assigned anywhere in a function as **local for the entire function**, so bare `_save_pending` calls in the ROOM_TRANSFER step machine raised `UnboundLocalError` whenever no earlier branch had executed its local import. Symptom: at the rent confirm prompt, replying "1" triggered the resolver to throw, the caller silently swallowed it, bot replied "I didn't understand that". This was masked by the bed-count refusal in 1.49.4 — no one ever reached the rent step.

### Root cause #2 — day-wise stays not counted
1.49.4 only counted active long-term `Tenancy` rows. Day-wise guests sleeping in the destination room weren't counted, so a fully-booked day-stay room still looked free.

### Fix (`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`)
- Top of `resolve_pending_action`: unconditional `from ... import _save_pending` so every branch is safe regardless of which conditional fires.
- `_finalize_room_transfer`: bed count now sums active `Tenancy` + `DaywiseStay` overlapping today; full-room message lists both groups.

### Test (`tests/test_room_transfer_e2e.py`)
New e2e harness auto-discovers a partially-occupied multi-bed room + a full one + an active mover, then walks the full flow per `sop_testing.md`:
- A — PARTIAL: `move X to Y` → disambig → pick → confirm with roommate line → "1" keep rent → "0" no extra deposit → final cancel
- B — FULL: `move X to Z` → disambig → pick → "Room Z is full (n/max beds)" with occupant list
- C — garbage at disambig → KEEP_PENDING (pending alive)
- D — cancel mid-flow → pending resolved cleanly

Safe on live DB (always cancels at final step). All scenarios green.

## [1.49.7] — 2026-04-23 — Three-tier rent reminders + Rs.200/day late fee

### Cadence (all delivered via approved Meta templates — no 24h CS-window required)
1. **Tier 1 — Advance**: 2 days before each new month (e.g. Apr 29 for May), 9am IST → `rent_reminder` template to **every active tenant**.
2. **Tier 2 — Day 1**: 1st of the month, 9am IST → `rent_reminder` template to **every active tenant**.
3. **Tier 3 — Daily overdue chaser**: 2nd onwards every day at 9am IST → `general_notice` template (custom wording) to **unpaid tenants only**. Stops the day after a tenant's balance clears.

### Late fee
- **Rs.200 per day** on payments made on or after the **6th**. Accrues daily until balance clears.
- Reminders from day 2 warn about the upcoming fee; from day 6 they show the running total (`Rs.200 × N day(s) = Rs.X`).
- Constants: `LATE_FEE_PER_DAY = 200`, `LATE_FEE_FROM_DAY = 6` in [src/scheduler.py](src/scheduler.py).
- **Not yet auto-charged** — fee is shown in reminder text only; `rent_schedule.due_amount` is not auto-incremented (follow-up, needs schema decision).

### Implementation
- `_rent_reminder()` rewritten with a `mode` kwarg (`advance` / `day1` / `overdue_daily`) replacing the old `label`. Advance-mode query falls back to `tenancy.agreed_rent` when `rent_schedule` row for next month doesn't exist yet.
- `rent_reminder_early` job ID reused for Tier 2 (now targets all active, not just unpaid).
- `rent_reminder_late` job ID reused for Tier 3 (trigger changed from day=15 to daily; self-skips on day 1).
- New `rent_reminder_advance` job; daily cron, self-skips unless `day == last_day_of_month - 1`.

### Docs updated
- [docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md](docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md) § 8a — due date + late fee.
- [memory/project_billing_rules.md](../memory/project_billing_rules.md) — cadence + fee rule.

## [1.49.6] — 2026-04-23 — Sheet access fix (cozeevoemp1) + nightly DB↔Sheet drift audit

### Background
- cozeevoemp1@gmail.com had Editor role on the Operations v2 sheet but couldn't apply filters on any tab. Root cause: every tab has an entire-sheet protection whose editor list only included the service account + cozeevo@gmail.com. Protections block filter/sort for non-allowed editors even with file-level Edit access.
- No mechanism existed to detect drift if someone with edit rights accidentally overwrote a cell. Bot reads DB only — it would never notice, and the sheet would silently show wrong numbers to anyone viewing it directly.

### Fix — editor access (`scripts/grant_sheet_editor.py`, new)
- Programmatically adds an email to the file's Drive permissions AND to every protected range's editor list.
- Applied to cozeevoemp1@gmail.com — now appears in all 8 protections (DASHBOARD, TENANTS, DEC 2025 – APR 2026, DAY WISE). Filter/sort/column-resize now works for him.
- `scripts/list_sheet_protections.py` (new) — audit tool for who can edit each protected range.

### Feature — nightly sheet audit
- **`src/services/sheet_audit.py`** (new) — compares TENANTS + current-month tab cells against DB on Room, Agreed Rent, Deposit, Notice Date, Checkout Date (TENANTS) and Room, Rent, Cash, UPI, Total Paid (monthly). Per-phone match; normalises numbers/dates; tolerates minor formatting. Skips Balance/Prev Due/Event/Status (proration-heavy — out of scope).
- **`scripts/sheet_audit.py`** (new) — CLI wrapper. Flags: `--alert` (WhatsApp ADMIN_PHONE on diffs), `--json` (machine-readable). Exit 0 if clean, 1 if diffs.
- **`src/scheduler.py::_nightly_sheet_audit`** — new APScheduler job at 23:30 IST daily. Silent when clean; WhatsApps admin with preview + total counts when diffs found. Does NOT auto-heal because `sync_sheet_from_db.py --write` preserves sheet Cash/UPI (would lock in accidental zeros). Kiran triages, then runs heal manually.

### What the first run will catch (55+ pre-existing issues as of today's dry-run)
- Room moves not reflected in sheet (Prasad 520, Chinmay 124, Sujith 621, G.D. Abhishek 612).
- Notice dates set via bot but sheet empty for 3 tenants (Didla, Shivam, Aldrin).
- Deposit mismatches (Akshit, Aruf: sheet 13500 vs DB 11500).
- Missing Cash/UPI on 5+ April rows where DB has payments logged (Chinmay 41K, Arun R L 19.5K, Pooja K L 19.5K, Rakesh 20K, Rohit 20078).
- 4 sheet rows with no matching DB tenancy (Pranav Sonawane, Prabhakaran, Shashank).

### Ops
- Scheduler now registers 10 jobs (was 9). State persists in Supabase jobstore; one VPS worker owns the scheduler via fcntl lock.
- No DB schema change. No new env vars (uses existing `ADMIN_PHONE`).

## [1.49.5] — 2026-04-23 — Double-booking guard, March = source, day-wise cleanup

### Double-booking guard (closes 1.49.4 follow-up)
- **`src/services/room_occupancy.py`** — new `check_room_bookable()`. Gate for every new booking. Checks in order: room exists in master data → room active → not `is_staff_room` → no active Staff assigned (one staff bed ⇒ whole room blocked) → no tenancy/day-stay overlap.
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`** (ASSIGN_ROOM_STEP ask_room branch) — inline check replaced with `check_room_bookable`.
- **`src/api/onboarding_router.py`** (approve, both daily + monthly paths) — guard placed before the branch so one call covers both. Returns 409 with specific reason.
- Verified live against DB: non-existent room, staff-flag room, occupied room (returns occupant name), and vacant room all behave correctly.

### March = Cozeevo Monthly stay source sheet (frozen)
- **`scripts/reload_march_from_source.py`** (new) — voids all DB March rent payments, re-inserts from source sheet (`1jOCVBkVurLNaht9HYKR6SFqGCciIoMWeOJkfKF9essk` → History tab). 374 old voided, 233 fresh inserted. 22 tenants present in source have no DB tenancy (pre-existing gap; logged).
- **`scripts/mirror_march_source_to_ops.py`** (new) — copies source sheet → Ops v2 MARCH 2026 tab 1:1 (bypasses DB for 100% match). Sheet now shows Cash ₹10,94,220 / UPI ₹28,89,193 / Balance ₹89,250 — exact source match.
- **`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`** — frozen-months guard: refuses `--write` for Dec 2025, Jan/Feb/Mar 2026 unless `--force-frozen`. Message points operators at `mirror_march_source_to_ops.py` for source reloads.

### Day-wise tab fixes
- **`scripts/sync_daywise_from_db.py`** — stay-period back-filled from checkin/checkout when DB field is empty (was 24 empty rows from old Excel imports). Stale `CHECKIN` rows with past checkout auto-flip to `EXIT` at display layer.
- **`scripts/import_missing_daywise_from_april_sheet.py`** (new) — imports day-wise guests entered manually in April Month Collection but missing from DB. 9 inserted (Mohit rana, maharajan, Mangesh Gosavi, etc.).
- DB backfill: 5 stale `CHECKIN`/`ACTIVE` rows with past checkout flipped to `EXIT`. Mohit rana checkout corrected to 2026-04-24 (source days=2 was stale).
- Result: DB day-wise 92→101 rows, active today 3→6 (matches April Month Collection).

### Memory
- `memory/feedback_no_double_booking.md` — saves the rule with rationale and trigger points.

## [1.49.4] — 2026-04-23 — Room transfer/assign: count beds, not occupants

### Root cause
`_finalize_room_transfer` and `ASSIGN_ROOM_STEP` (pick_tenant inline branch) refused the move whenever **any** active tenancy existed in the destination room — they never compared against `Room.max_occupancy`. So Lokesh couldn't move a tenant into any double/triple room that already had one occupant, even with a free bed. Same bug blocked first-time room assignment for shared rooms.

### Fix (`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`)
- `_finalize_room_transfer` — counts active tenancies excluding the moving tenant, compares to `max_occupancy`. Refuses only when room is full. Confirm prompt now lists existing roommate(s) and shows `(n+1)/max` bed usage.
- `ASSIGN_ROOM_STEP` pick_tenant inline check — same bed-count logic; error reads `"Room X is full (n/max beds)"` instead of "is occupied".
- Aligns with `feedback_no_double_booking.md`: bed-slot count is the contract (double = 2, triple = 3).

### Known follow-up
- `src/services/room_occupancy.py:find_overlap_conflict` / `check_room_bookable` still use any-occupant blocking. Affects `ADD_TENANT`, onboarding form approve, day-stay booking, and the `ASSIGN_ROOM_STEP` ask_room branch. Not fixed in this commit — needs its own audit per the no-double-booking memory.

## [1.49.3] — 2026-04-23 — Fix duplicate reminders + silent non-delivery

### Root causes (diagnosed from `whatsapp_log` + `apscheduler_jobs`)
- **Duplicate fires**: systemd runs `uvicorn --workers 2` so each worker constructed its own APScheduler against the same Supabase jobstore. Every cron fired twice — 10 outbound rows for today's prep reminder, 2 per recipient, 2–5 ms apart per pair.
- **Silent non-delivery**: prep reminder used `_send_whatsapp` (free-form `type: "text"`), which Meta only delivers inside the 24-hour customer-service window. Prabhakaran received (he's in Meta's test-recipient allowlist); Kiran / Lakshmi / Lokesh / Business Number fell outside the window and Meta silently dropped after returning 200.
- **Minor contributor**: 10-digit phones (`7845952289`, `8548884455`) reached Meta without the `91` country code, which can also cause silent drops.

### Fixes
- **`src/scheduler.py`** — `_acquire_scheduler_lock()` via `fcntl.flock` on `/tmp/pg-accountant-scheduler.lock`; only the winning worker starts the scheduler, losers return a no-op `AsyncIOScheduler`. Windows skips the lock (single-worker dev).
- **`src/scheduler.py _prep_reminder`** — now sends via the approved `general_notice` template (`send_template`) instead of free-form text. Templates bypass the 24h window, so recipients no longer need to have messaged the bot first. Also selects `name` from `authorized_users` to fill `{{1}}`.
- **`src/whatsapp/webhook_handler.py`** — new `_to_e164_for_meta()` helper; Indian 10-digit mobiles (first digit 6–9) get `91` prepended before every outbound send (`_send_whatsapp`, `_send_whatsapp_template`, `_send_whatsapp_interactive`, `_send_whatsapp_document`).
- **`src/whatsapp/reminder_sender.py`** — `_clean_phone()` applies the same prefix rule so the official reminder-number path is consistent.

## [1.49.2] — 2026-04-22 — P&L rebuild: cash-inclusive, March DB↔sheet 1:1 reload, new categories, consolidated SOP

### Classifier rule updates (`src/rules/pnl_classify.py`)
- **New category "Operational Expenses"** — Amazon (always) + `akhilreddy007420` (per Kiran).
- **New category "Waste Disposal"** — Pavan (`6366411789` / "garbage collection"), ₹3.5K/mo fixed.
- **New category "Capital Investment"** — CCTV cheque `CHQ W/L_KIRAN KUMAR PEMMA SANI-BELLANDUR` (₹82K Nov).
- Removed over-broad `airtel` keyword (was catching `*.rzp@rxairtel` / `*.payu@mairtel` Razorpay/PayU rails) — only `airtelpredirect` matches now. Zepto/Flipkart/Origin Mandi now route to their true categories.
- Jio (`jioinappdirect`) + Vi (`viinappguj`) recharges → Staff & Labour / Staff Mobile Recharge (not Internet).
- 7 tenant deposit refund handle rules: `chandrasekhar1996krish`, `amalsreenimj`, `adithya3sri`, `kuhanmohan123`, `t.srinivasa34`, `swamivenkatesh264`, `ksshyamreddy`.
- `cleaners advance` / `8787621802` → Staff & Labour / Cleaners Advance.

### Data — March DB↔Source Sheet 1:1 reload
- Detected drift: DB had 279 tenants × ₹53.66L March rent vs sheet 227 × ₹39.83L (₹13.83L phantom in DB, mostly cash).
- Voided 372 old March rent payments (audit preserved, `is_void=True`).
- Inserted 258 fresh payments matching sheet 1:1 (cash ₹10,94,220 + UPI ₹28,89,193).
- Backup: `data/backups/march_rent_payments_before_20260422_173828.csv`.
- Loader glob updated in `scripts/export_classified.py` to pick up renamed `2026 statment.csv` (was `Statement-*.csv`) + tolerate missing optional xlsx.

### Accrual overrides locked in SOP
- **Property Rent**: ₹21.32L/mo (164 rooms × ₹13K) starting Jan 2026, paid 10th of next month (~₹6L UPI + ~₹15.32L cash per month). Replaces bank-classifier ₹12.05L two-month total.
- **Internet**: ₹15,514/mo effective (Airwire ₹1.13L + WiFi Vendor ₹1.04L = ₹2.17L for 14 months from Feb, covering both buildings).
- **Police (Pradeep)**: ₹3,000/mo fixed cash-paid, rarely in bank.
- **Cash-only flag** on Water / Maintenance / Housekeeping / Vegetables — bank shows ≤10% of real spend; ≈₹3.5L/mo leakage not in bank P&L.

### Simple P&L result (Oct'25–Mar'26, bank-visible accrual)
Revenue ₹1,12,40,175 − Opex ₹90,77,293 = **Net Profit ₹21,62,882 (19.2%)**.
After adjusting for ~₹17L cash-ops leakage: real profit ≈ **₹4.6L** (essentially break-even, operations funded by refundable deposits). Refundable Security Deposit liability ₹21,56,125 (252 active tenants, Kiran's April-Collection method).

### Memory consolidation
- Deleted: `feedback_reporting.md`, `feedback_pnl_report.md`, `feedback_pnl_fixed_rules.md`, `project_pnl_oct25_mar26.md`, `project_pnl_reclassification.md`.
- New single SOP: `memory/sop_pnl.md` (10 steps) — source data, classifier rules, income/expense accrual overrides, March reload procedure, refundable-deposit method, cash-position framework, peer benchmark, hard rule "never estimate cash, ask Kiran".
- Session snapshot for tomorrow: `memory/project_pnl_session_2026_04_22.md`.

### Open questions for next session
- Actual cash-in-hand (Kiran) — my ₹30L estimate was wrong.
- Landlord security deposit/advance at PG startup.
- April bank CSV (current file ends 31-Mar).
- Identify volipi.l / arunphilip25 / tpasha638 (still in Other Expenses).

## [1.49.1] — 2026-04-22 — Pending scope rule locked (no-shows excluded) + standard formula reinstated

### Formula stance (authoritative)
- Kiran reversed an earlier Option A "trust source cash+upi+balance for rent_due" — our standard `first_month_rent_due = agreed_rent + security_deposit` is authoritative. Source sheet is data only. Reverted `scripts/sync_from_source_sheet.py` to call `first_month_rent_due()` for new April RentSchedules. Pending back to **Rs.2,56,123** (Rs.45,35,375 billed − Rs.42,79,252 effective paid).

### Pending scope rule — month only, no-shows excluded
- **Confirmed:** Source "April Balance" sum Rs.3,26,054 = Rs.1,45,054 real April pending + **Rs.1,81,000 from 7 no-shows** (May/June checkins still listed with their future first-month due in source). No-shows don't have an April RentSchedule in our DB, so they're automatically excluded from Pending(April). Kiran confirmed this is correct.
- **Doc updates:** `docs/REPORTING.md §11.2` new subsection + `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md §2.4` + memory `sop_db_sheet_financial.md` rule #8. Enforcement already in place via RentSchedule iteration.
- Reconciliation scripts: `scripts/april_balance_29.py` (per-tenant view of the 29 source-Balance rows) and `scripts/gap_report_xlsx.py` (updated for booking/deposit/prepaid credits) saved under `data/reports/`.

### Format
- All financial figures in Indian-comma format via `src/utils/money.inr()` — ops sheet summary + bot WhatsApp monthly report. No more "12.03 L" abbreviations.

---

## [1.49.0] — 2026-04-21 (full day) — April/March reconciliation, format unification, reminder + onboarding fixes

### Critical data fixes
- **April drop+reload** — `scripts/sync_from_source_sheet.py` now hard-DELETEs all April payments (any for_type) + rent_schedule before reload. Prior voided-only behaviour caused 2x duplication when the 03:00 IST scheduler ran the old version against my fresh inserts (Cash jumped to 24.16L / UPI 60.02L). DB now matches source exactly: Cash 11.61L / UPI 30.01L / Total 41.62L / 279 payments.
- **March settlement** (`scripts/settle_march_dues.py`) — 116 settlement Payments totalling Rs.14.67L inserted; March RentSchedule statuses flipped to paid. April ops sheet Prev Due = 0.
- **Booking credit no longer inflates Cash/UPI cols** — `sync_sheet_from_db.py` tracks booking as `booking_credit` applied only to balance/status via `effective_paid`, keeping Cash/UPI display in parity with source sheet.
- **Rakesh 415 duplicate merged** — payment + rent_schedule reassigned from tenancy 899 (T.Rakesh Chetan) to 894 (Rakesh Thallapally); 899 + its Tenant row hard-deleted; phone normalised to `+919515739255`.
- **Yash Shinde (416)** — agreed_rent 0→11500, sharing single→double, lock_in_months=4, RentRevision row for 11500→12000 effective 2026-06-01, April rent_schedule.rent_due=23500 (first-month). Balance now Rs.0.
- **agreed_rent backfill** — Chinmay (22000), Ajay (12000), Mamta (12000), Yuvaraj (12500).

### Code fixes
- **Onboarding approve for day-stays** (`src/api/onboarding_router.py`) — `tenancy` and `effective_sharing` initialised to None so daily branch doesn't UnboundLocalError. Approve handler wrapped in try/except so real errors surface ("Approve failed: TypeError: …") instead of generic "Network error." Frontend updated to parse non-JSON error bodies. Verified with REDDY AJAY (room 609) — tenant 912 + DaywiseStay 185 created, DAY WISE sheet updated, session approved.
- **Intent misrouting fixed** (`src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py`) — `ADD_PARTNER` had unanchored `add\s+staff\b` that stole "G20 add staff room" etc. Added negative lookahead + 5 new UPDATE_ROOM alternations covering `<id> add/mark/set/is staff [room]`, `<id> not staff`, `mark <id> staff`, `add staff room <id>`, `<id> staff room`. 13 tests green.
- **Reminder scheduler** — `_prep_reminder` now queries daywise_stays alongside tenancies for the target date so prebookings appear. Silence-on-empty behaviour kept per Kiran's preference.
- **TENANTS tab canonical format** — `_sync_tenant_all_fields_sync` writes phone as +91XXXXXXXXXX, building as "HULK"/"THOR" (stripped "Cozeevo"), Title-Case gender/sharing/status. `scripts/normalize_tenants_tab.py` bulk-pushed canonical values: 270 cells updated across 266 tenants, 0 errors.
- **`Room.floor` helper** — `src/utils/room_floor.derive_floor()` single source of truth (G→0, else first digit). Backfill script (`scripts/backfill_room_floors.py`) confirms all 167 rooms already correct (earlier audit's "32 NULL" was a falsy-zero bug).

### Added tests
- `tests/test_my_balance_prev_due.py` (2)
- `tests/test_deposit_change_confirm.py` (4 — prevents Pooja-style corruption via stray "1")
- `tests/test_staff_room_intent.py` (13)
- `tests/test_staff_room_invariant.py` (4 — whole-room exclusion on any staff)

### Audits + docs
- `docs/audit_premium_2026-04-21.md` — premium = 22 (sheet) vs 23 (DB), resolved via 415 merge.
- `docs/audit_room_anomalies_2026-04-21.md` — 2 mixed-sharing rooms (416, 610), 46 rent-mismatch rooms (mostly ±500-1000 grandfathered), 5 big gaps worth review.
- `docs/audit_missing_fields_2026-04-21.md` — 5 UNASSIGNED (future May/June check-ins), 10 deposit=0 rows.
- `memory/sop_april_reload.md` — standing drop+reload playbook for monthly sync divergence.
- `memory/project_pnl_oct25_mar26.md` — P&L after dedup + loan-reclass fixes. Rs.19.5L moved from Property Rent → Non-Operating. YTD EBITDA Rs.32.1L, Net Rs.71k. Flags: property-rent still thin (Rs.12L vs expected ~60L), Other Expenses catch-all needs vendor-naming pass.

### DEPOSIT_CHANGE confirm step
- [src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py:2971-3011](src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py#L2971-L3011) — numeric reply on DEPOSIT_CHANGE_AMT now saves a confirm pending instead of writing the deposit immediately.

### Kiran actions awaiting
- Review P&L audit flags in `memory/project_pnl_oct25_mar26.md`.
- Fill source sheet cell for Yash Shinde (col J) if rent still needed there.
- Review auto-push git hook (every commit pushes to origin; flagged by all agents).

---

## [1.48.0] — 2026-04-21 (morning #2) — Parallel agent batch

### Added
- **`MY_BALANCE` regression tests** ([tests/test_my_balance_prev_due.py](tests/test_my_balance_prev_due.py)) — 2 cases verifying prev-month carry-forward. Bug itself already fixed in `d6d83f9`.
- **`DEPOSIT_CHANGE` confirm step** ([src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py:2971-3011](src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py#L2971-L3011)) — numeric reply on `DEPOSIT_CHANGE_AMT` now saves a `DEPOSIT_CHANGE` confirm pending (Yes/1 to apply, cancel to abort) instead of writing deposit immediately. Prevents Pooja-style accidental corruption from stray "1" replies. 4 pytests all green.
- **`scripts/backfill_agreed_rent.py`** — idempotent dry-run + `--write` backfill for tenancies with `agreed_rent = 0/NULL`.
- **`docs/audit_premium_2026-04-21.md`** — premium sharing audit (22 on sheet, 23 in DB). Found duplicate tenancy: room 415 has both `Rakesh Thallapally` (phone `9515739255` no +91) and `T.Rakesh Chetan` (phone `+919515739255`). Same person — one is stale. Kiran to decide which to close.

### Executed on local → VPS
- **agreed_rent backfill** — 4 rows written with audit_log: Chinmay Pagey (22000), Ajay Ramchandra (12000), Mamta Khandade (12000), Yuvaraj (12500). Yash Shinde (416) skipped — source sheet cell blank; needs manual rent entry.
- VPS `git pull` + `systemctl restart` — latest master deployed, service active.

### Findings (Kiran action)
- **Rakesh Thallapally dupe (room 415)** — close one tenancy; name-variant + phone-normalisation issue. See audit doc.
- **Yash Shinde (416)** — `agreed_rent` still 0; source sheet col J is empty. Fill source or tell me the rent to write directly.
- **Pre-commit/post-commit hook auto-pushes** — every `git commit` pushes to origin. Noted by all 4 agents; review if unintended.

---

## [1.47.0] — 2026-04-21 (morning) — April drop+reload parity + March settlement

### Fixed
- **`scripts/sync_from_source_sheet.py`** — hard-DELETE all April payments + rent_schedule before reload (any `for_type`, any `is_void`). Prior behavior voided only rent-type, leaving 34 booking payments with `period_month=April` inflating DB totals by Rs.1.37L. When 03:00 IST scheduler reran the old script against the new inserts, totals doubled (Cash 24.16L / UPI 60.02L). Drop+reload now idempotent.
- **`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`** — booking advances no longer bundled into Cash/UPI display columns; tracked as `booking_credit` and applied to balance + status via `effective_paid`. Ops sheet Cash/UPI now matches source sheet exactly.

### Executed on local → VPS
- **April full drop+reload**: 279 payments repopulated from source. DB == source == ops sheet = Cash Rs.11.61L / UPI Rs.30.01L / Total Rs.41.62L (exact match).
- **March settlement** (`scripts/settle_march_dues.py`) — Kiran confirmed all March dues paid. Inserted 116 settlement Payment rows totaling Rs.14.67L, marked March RentSchedule status=paid. April ops sheet `Prev Due` now Rs.0, `Pending` reflects only April-month outstanding.

### Added
- **`memory/sop_april_reload.md`** — standing procedure for monthly drop+reload whenever source sheet totals diverge from DB/ops. Steps: fetch source truth → compare → hard-delete → reload DB → reload sheet → verify to-the-rupee. Indexed in MEMORY.md.

---

## [1.46.0] — 2026-04-20 (late night #4) — Batch 4: cash+UPI split, entered_by wiring, booking migration

### Added
- **Cash+UPI split one-liner parser** ([intent_detector.py](src/whatsapp/intent_detector.py), [account_handler.py](src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py), [owner_handler.py](src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py)) — `"Diya paid 3000 cash 3000 upi"` now parses as split: `entities["split_payment"]=True`, `cash_amount`, `upi_amount`. Confirmation shows the breakdown; on affirmative, two `Payment` rows written with `skip_duplicate_check=True` (pair is intentional).
- **`entered_by` end-to-end wiring** — [src/services/payments.py](src/services/payments.py) `log_payment` resolves `recorded_by` (caller phone/name) → `Staff.phone` last-10-digit lookup → sets `Payment.received_by_staff_id`. [scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py](scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py) tracks latest Payment per tenancy in the period, bulk-joins Staff.id → Staff.name, populates the "entered by" sheet column from DB. Sheet fallback retained during migration.
- **`scripts/migrate_booking_amount_to_payment.py`** — one-time, idempotent backfill. Dry-run by default. Creates missing `Payment(for_type=booking, period=checkin_month)` rows for every `Tenancy.booking_amount > 0` that had none. Audit-logged per row with `source='migration'`.

### Executed on VPS
- **Booking migration** — 287 candidates, 244 already had Payment, **43 new Payment rows committed**. Mostly ₹2,000 standard advances; outliers ₹18,375 / ₹26,000 / ₹15,000 / ₹13,000 / ₹6,078. First-month balances for those 43 Excel-imported tenants now correct.
- **April sheet refreshed** after migration: 273 rows written, Cash ₹12.13L + UPI ₹29.68L = ₹41.81L, 150 PAID / 90 PARTIAL / 12 UNPAID.

### Fixed
- Excel-imported tenants' balance no longer overstates first-month dues by the booking advance amount (was systematic underpay report for those 43 tenants).

---

## [1.45.0] — 2026-04-20 (late night #3) — Daily prep reminders + disambig E2E verified

### Added
- **`prep_reminder_today` / `prep_reminder_tomorrow` scheduler jobs** ([src/scheduler.py](src/scheduler.py)) — two separate morning/afternoon WhatsApp reminders to every admin/owner/receptionist (incl. Lokesh `7680814628`) listing that day's check-ins + check-outs so rooms can be prepared.
  - 09:00 IST — TODAY's movements (morning briefing).
  - 14:00 IST — TOMORROW's movements (afternoon prep heads-up, full day of lead time).
  - Each message suppresses if its target day has zero check-ins AND zero check-outs (no empty-list noise). Sections (Check-ins / Check-outs) suppress independently.
  - Data: `tenancies.checkin_date` with status in (active, no_show) for arrivals; `tenancies.expected_checkout` with status active for departures. No schema change — every field already in DB + sheet.
- **`tests/test_disambig_e2e.py`** — 15/15 passing. Routes messages through full pipeline (`chat_api pending check` → `intent_detector` → `gatekeeper` → `handler` → `pending` → `resolver`) for every name-based intent. Safe on live DB (auto-cancels every mutating path; seeds `zzDupStaff` for staff-intent tests and cleans up).

### Fixed
- **Scheduler timezone** — pre-existing `AsyncIOScheduler(timezone="Asia/Kolkata")` wasn't propagating to `CronTrigger` instances; my new jobs fire at actual IST wall-clock times by passing `timezone="Asia/Kolkata"` to the trigger itself. Other jobs still fire in UTC — documented as follow-up; no behaviour change today.
- **Monthly tabs sort by check-in ascending** — latest arrival lives at the bottom. [scripts/clean_and_load.py](scripts/clean_and_load.py), [scripts/create_month.py](scripts/create_month.py), [scripts/reload_april.py](scripts/reload_april.py) updated; new [scripts/sort_monthly_by_checkin.py](scripts/sort_monthly_by_checkin.py) one-off ran against DEC 2025 → APRIL 2026 with per-tab CSV backup.
- **Dashboard banner auto-refresh on every bot-driven cell write** ([src/integrations/gsheets.py](src/integrations/gsheets.py)) — `_update_tenant_field_sync`, `_update_checkin_sync`, `_sync_tenant_all_fields_sync` all call `_refresh_summary_sync` post-write so Active / Beds / Vacant / Occupancy recompute immediately after sharing / rent / check-in changes.
- **Silent-pick disambig bugs** in `_add_refund` / `assign_staff_to_room` / `exit_staff_from_room` — all three now save a `_WHO` pending and show numbered choices when multiple entities match. New resolver branches for `ASSIGN_STAFF_WHO`, `EXIT_STAFF_WHO`, `REFUND_WHO`.
- **`ASSIGN_STAFF_ROOM` / `EXIT_STAFF` intents** — bot commands `staff [name] room [num]`, `staff [name] exit`, `assign staff [name] to [num]`. Many staff per room allowed (no sharing-cap enforcement). Auto-flips `Room.is_staff_room` true on assign, back to false only when the last staff leaves.

### Operational
- **VPS storage reality check** — All uploaded files (KYC, receipts, agreements) live on VPS local disk, not Supabase Storage. Current usage: 4.1 MB media + 164 KB agreements on 48 GB disk (44 GB free). Supabase free tier fine indefinitely for DB (~50 MB). Real risk = **backup** (none today). Options in pending tasks: Hostinger weekly backup / rsync to R2 nightly / migrate to Supabase Storage.

### Deferred
- Other pre-existing scheduler jobs still fire in UTC (rent reminders, daily reconciliation, etc.). No one's noticed — fixing them independently if they become a problem.
- Tenant-path complaint resolver still unconditionally sets `pending.resolved = True` (`chat_api.py:443`). Fine today because complaints are single-turn.

## [1.44.0] — 2026-04-20 (late night #2) — Audit batch 3 + MY_BALANCE + flow collision guard

### Sync invariant (batch 3 partial)
- **`sync_sheet_from_db.py`** now sources `notice date` + `notes` from `Tenancy.notice_date` / `Tenancy.notes` (DB). Sheet-preserved fallback kept during migration so existing sheet-only notes aren't wiped. `entered by` still sheet-only (TODO: derive from `Payment.received_by_staff`).

### Audit trail (batch 3 partial)
- **[owner_handler.py `_do_add_tenant`](src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py)** writes an `AuditLog` entry per checkin (summarises all generated `RentSchedule` rows + rent/deposit/advance values). Separately audits the booking-advance `Payment` with amount + mode. Previously checkin was DB-only with no audit record.

### User-visible bugs fixed
- **`MY_BALANCE` single-month query** ([tenant_handler.py:104](src/whatsapp/handlers/tenant_handler.py#L104)) now includes prev-month unpaid carry-forward. Was showing wrong outstanding when tenant asked about specific month while unpaid from earlier.
- **Workflow-collision guard** in [chat_api.py](src/whatsapp/chat_api.py). When user has an unresolved pending and the new message is classified as a different intent, bot no longer silently vaporises the pending. Instead: *"You're in the middle of a <X> flow. Reply *cancel* to stop it, or continue with your answer."* Greetings still clear silently (low-risk). Root cause of Prabhakaran's mid-sharing-change loss on 2026-04-20. Surfaces to logs as `FLOW_COLLISION`.

### Deferred (in `project_pending_tasks.md`)
- CASCADE DELETE on `RentSchedule.tenancy_id` + `Payment.unique_hash` — schema migration, needs careful backfill
- `SELECT...FOR UPDATE` pessimistic locking on concurrent Tenancy mutations
- ADD_REFUND/QUERY_REFUNDS regex overlap — inspected, pattern ordering already correct for real-world inputs. Not a real bug.

---

## [1.43.0] — 2026-04-20 (late night) — Audit batches 1 + 2

Acted on parallel security/flow/sync/scheduler audit (4 Explore subagents).

### Security & infra (batch 1)
- **Webhook signature now FAILS CLOSED.** [`webhook_handler.py`](src/whatsapp/webhook_handler.py) used to silently skip the X-Hub-Signature-256 check if `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` was missing or still the placeholder. Now: production rejects all requests until secret set; dev opt-out via `WHATSAPP_SKIP_SIG_CHECK=1`.
- **`/api/entities/{pending,approve,reject}` now require admin PIN** ([main.py:297-323](main.py#L297-L323)). Were fully open — anyone could approve master-data entries.
- **All `subprocess.run` paths use `sys.executable`** instead of hardcoded `venv/Scripts/python` (Windows-only). Affected: [sync_router.py](src/api/sync_router.py), [scheduler.py](src/scheduler.py), [run_monthly_rollover.py](scripts/run_monthly_rollover.py). VPS no longer relies on identical relative path.
- **`_overnight_source_sync` alerts admin on failure.** Steps 2 + 3 now check returncode (were silent). Failures Whatsapp the admin via `_send_whatsapp` so silent corruption can't drift.

### Handler bugs (batch 2)
- **`pending.resolved = True`** added at 5 sites in [owner_handler.py](src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py): COLLECT_RECEIPT skip (945), COLLECT_RECEIPT save (978), UNDERPAYMENT_NOTE skip (2695), UNDERPAYMENT_NOTE save (2710), OVERPAYMENT_ADD_NOTE save (2683). All previously returned success but left pending alive → user looped forever.
- **Overpayment carry-forward Payment** ([owner_handler.py:2623](src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py#L2623)) now writes AuditLog + fires `sync_tenant_all_fields`. Was DB-only — dashboard "Total Paid" KPI went stale.

### Verified safe before deploy
- VPS `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` confirmed set + not placeholder
- `ONBOARDING_ADMIN_PIN` confirmed configured

---

## [1.42.0] — 2026-04-20 (night) — Monthly rollover + rules single-source

### Added
- **`src/services/monthly_rollover.py`** — new DB-side generator. Upserts `RentSchedule` rows for the target month. Idempotent. Rules: active + no_show only; exited/cancelled skipped; first-month prorate; no-show → `RentStatus.na` + 0 due; no-shows carry every month until they check in.
- **`scripts/run_monthly_rollover.py`** — atomic rollover runner. Sequence: source-sheet → DB → RentSchedule generation → sheet tab → sheet↔DB reconcile. Manual: `python scripts/run_monthly_rollover.py MAY 2026`.
- **`/api/onboarding/{token}` now returns `rules`** — substituted `HOUSE_RULES` (pdf_generator.py is single source). Form renders them dynamically into `#rules-container`; no more drift between form and PDF.

### Changed
- **Scheduler rollover trigger** — moved from 1st-of-month 12:30 AM to **second-last calendar day 11 PM IST**. Job self-checks day using `calendar.monthrange` (handles 28/29/30/31-day months + leap years automatically). Calls `scripts/run_monthly_rollover.py` end-to-end.
- **`_monthly_tab_rollover`** — now a proper atomic rollover, not just a sheet-tab writer. Source sync runs first (no more ordering race vs 3 AM `_overnight_source_sync`).
- **[static/onboarding.html](static/onboarding.html)** — hardcoded 10-rule list removed; rules now fetched from API.

### Fixed
- **Silent DB↔sheet divergence on rollover** — the old `create_month.py` wrote the sheet tab but never created `RentSchedule` rows. Bot's dues calculations would've diverged from sheet from May onwards. Now the atomic runner generates both.

### Notes
- Deposit-pending carry-forward stays in the existing notes column (create_month.py:151-155). Sufficient per Kiran — first-month rent_due already includes deposit; any pending rolls into prev_due naturally.
- Custom x-to-x billing cycles are NOT supported in code. Prorated first-month is the only mode. For x-to-x clients, add a `notes` entry manually and remember to skip last-month rent.

---

## [1.41.0] — 2026-04-20 (late evening #2) — Sync invariant + live ops fixes

Post-compact session. Focus: closing every gap between DB ↔ sheet ↔ dashboard KPIs, plus live UX bugs Prabhakaran / Lokesh hit.

### Added
- **`cozeevo_checkout_confirmation` wired** into `_do_checkout` ([owner_handler.py](src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py)) — fire-and-forget template + free-text fallback. Active once Meta approves.
- **`cozeevo_payment_received` wired** into `_do_log_payment_by_ids` ([account_handler.py](src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py)) — 4 vars, no payment mode.
- **`src/database/field_registry.py`** — Phase 1 field registry. 40+ `Field` entries as single source of truth. Derives `MONTHLY_HEADERS`, `TENANTS_HEADERS`, `_TENANTS_FIELD_TO_HEADER`, `_FIELD_TO_COL`, plus `fields_for_pwa()` helper for the future API endpoint.
- **Emergency Contact Phone** — additive TENANTS column (legacy "Emergency Contact" column stays, now strictly name-only).
- **`tests/test_field_registry.py`** — 10 parity + invariant tests.
- **OnboardingSession.sharing_type column** + migration. Create-time receptionist override now persists. Approve honors it instead of falling back to `room.room_type` master.
- **Editable Sharing Type dropdown** in the review form ([admin_onboarding.html](static/admin_onboarding.html)). Receptionist can flip single/double/triple/premium per tenancy — never touches master data.
- **SHARING TYPE CHANGE** section in [docs/RECEPTIONIST_CHEAT_SHEET.md](docs/RECEPTIONIST_CHEAT_SHEET.md).
- **Generic `FIELD_UPDATE_WHO` disambiguation** — sharing / rent / phone / gender / deposit handlers in `update_handler.py` all use the `_disambiguate_or_pick` helper. No more LIMIT-1 silent-pick when 2+ tenants share a name (3 Rakesh case).
- **`Staff.room_id`** column + migration. Was referenced in handler code but missing in VPS schema → AttributeError on QUERY_STAFF_ROOMS.
- **Multi-room command support** in `update_room` — "not staff rooms 114 and 618" applies to both.
- **Bare-cancel short-circuit** in chat_api — `cancel / stop / abort / nevermind` with no pending returns a clean "Nothing to cancel right now." (Groq was hallucinating it as VOID_PAYMENT).
- **Prabhakaran granted `admin` role** via `authorized_users`.

### Fixed
- **Nginx `client_max_body_size` 1M → 20M** on `/etc/nginx/sites-available/pg-accountant`. Tenant form submits (signature + selfie + ID base64 ≈ 3MB) were silently rejected at edge. 6 failed attempts observed in nginx error log before this was caught.
- **`sync_tenant_all_fields`** — refund audit gap closed: now writes `Refund Status` + `Refund Amount` to TENANTS.
- **`_do_add_refund_by_ids`** — fires `sync_tenant_all_fields` post-flush. Was DB-only → dashboard pending-refund KPI went stale.
- **`_do_update_checkout_date`** — fires sheet sync post-flush. Was DB-only → exit-pipeline KPI went stale.
- **`resolve_field_update`** — after "Reply 1" confirm, the monthly-tab single-cell write is now followed by a systemic `sync_tenant_all_fields` so TENANTS master catches up. Previously only monthly tab updated.
- **5 cancel paths in `resolve_pending_action`** now set `pending.resolved = True`. Root cause of "cancel doesn't let me start a new flow" — pending row stayed alive so the next message bumped the same dead resolver.
- **FIELD_UPDATE_WHO resolver** — missing `_save_pending` import caused Python scoping error. Resolver returned None → chat_api killed the pending → fell through to ConversationAgent replying "I don't understand '3'". Prabhakaran saw this live; added explicit import.
- **`QUERY_STAFF_ROOMS` vs `UPDATE_ROOM` regex** — "not staff rooms 114 and 618" now routes to UPDATE_ROOM (was silently re-listing).
- **Sheet sharing-type after editable review** — `approve_session` uses `effective_sharing` in sheet write, not `room.room_type`.

### Changed
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py` — `MONTHLY_HEADERS` + 3 related structures now derive from the registry. Positional `T_*` / `M_*` indices preserved (refund write path unchanged).
- TENANTS tab 34 → 35 columns (additive Emergency Contact Phone).

### Sync invariant (now explicit, across the board)
Every bot-triggered DB mutation propagates:
- DB commit → instant
- Monthly + TENANTS sheet → 1-2s (fire-and-forget `sync_tenant_all_fields` or specialised per-event write)
- Google Sheet DASHBOARD tab → auto via `onEdit` trigger
- `/dashboard` web UI → still manual reload (no polling — left as optional follow-up)

### Commits in this session
`1245f89 → 9f2d151 → 2b38afa → 593734c → 7e6e5b4 → 9eba958 → efa48a1 → f45a508 → 48e5daa → 441a4e5 → 64f7617 → 7633abc → 71fa2e0 → 57fbecb`

### Still pending (carries to next session)
- Edit `cozeevo_booking_confirmation` body via Meta API once APPROVED.
- Phase 2 field registry: `GET /api/v2/app/field-registry` endpoint (helper already exists).
- Phase 3: PWA consumer of the registry.
- 16 state-management golden failures (carried from prior session).
- Web dashboard polling / SSE at `/dashboard`.
- Kiran: add "Emergency Contact Phone" column header in the TENANTS Google Sheet tab so the additive field starts populating.
- `MY_BALANCE` bug at `tenant_handler.py:104` (prev_due not included).
- Live Lokesh issues: staff-room unmark end-to-end retest (logic shipped, needs him to retry).

## [1.40.0] — 2026-04-20 (late evening) — State-mgmt fixes + RentSchedule first-month = rent + deposit

### Fixed (state management)
- **Staff-room toggle substring bug** — `_update_single_room` checked `"staff room" in desc_lower` before `"not staff"`, so "Not staff rooms 114 and 618" / "114 not staff room" hit the MARK branch (because `"staff room"` is a substring of `"staff rooms"` / `"not staff room"`). Lokesh 2026-04-20 16:49–16:59 thrashed 12 messages with rooms 114/618 flipping True↔False in audit log. Extracted `_classify_staff_toggle()` in `src/whatsapp/handlers/update_handler.py` — UNMARK patterns evaluated before MARK so negative phrasings always win. 19 parametrized tests lock it in.
- **`CONFIRM_FIELD_UPDATE` "Yes" → "Update cancelled"** — resolver did `choice = reply_text.strip()` (no `.lower()`), then `if choice in ("1","yes","y")`, so capital "Yes" fell to else → cancel. Partner 2026-04-20 16:42 sharing-change for Rakesh. Extracted `_is_confirm_choice()` accepting "1" + full `is_affirmative` set (any case). 25 parametrized tests lock it in.

### Fixed (financial — Diya Gupta blunder)
- **First-month `RentSchedule.rent_due` now bundles security deposit** per `memory/feedback_deposit_dues_logic.md`. Diya 2026-04-20: rent 12,000 + deposit 6,000, paid 12,000 UPI — bot said "This month: PAID" because `rs.rent_due` was only 12,000. Should have said PARTIAL with Rs.6,000 due.
- New helper **`src/services/rent_schedule.first_month_rent_due(tenancy, period)`** — returns rent + deposit when period == checkin_month, else just rent. Single source of truth.
- Wired into 5 RentSchedule creation sites: `src/services/payments.py`, `src/api/onboarding_router.py`, `src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py` (`_finalize_add_tenant`), `src/database/excel_import.py`, `src/database/delta_import.py`. Importers use inline check (their `period_rent` reflects rent revisions, not agreed_rent).
- **Display fix** — `_do_query_tenant_by_id` was `net_due = deposit + rs.rent_due - booking_amount`, so after backfill it double-counted deposit (Diya showed Rs.22,000). Now derives `first_rent = rs.rent_due − deposit` for display; net_due arithmetic unchanged.
- **Backfill script** `scripts/backfill_first_month_rent_due.py` — idempotent dry-run/apply. Ran `--apply` on VPS: **268 check-in-month RentSchedule rows corrected, 20 unchanged**. Status recomputed from non-void payments.

### Added
- `tests/test_staff_room_toggle.py`, `tests/test_confirm_field_update_choice.py`, `tests/test_first_month_rent_due.py` — **52 new parametrized tests**, all green on VPS post-deploy.

### Verified on VPS
- 3 commits deployed (`fix(state-mgmt)`, `fix(rent_schedule)`, `fix(query)`), service `active`, `/healthz` 200.
- Diya Gupta bot query now shows: `This month PARTIAL`, `First month rent Rs.12,000`, `Net due Rs.16,000`, `Apr: Rs.18,000 — PARTIAL (due Rs.6,000)`.

### Still pending (next session)
- **Sheet re-sync** for the 268 updated tenancies — DB and Sheet may show different Balance until `sync_sheet_from_db` runs.
- **"Raj balance doesn't work"** — Kiran flagged; needs repro with exact phrasing + which Raj (multiple exist).
- **Lokesh's 17:37 pending** `Diya Gupta paid 6000 cash` — pending confirmation not resolved; will expire via TTL.
- **booking_amount missing as Payment row** — old Excel-imported tenants have `tenancy.booking_amount > 0` but no `Payment(for_type=booking)` row, so Apr balance doesn't reflect the advance. One-time migration needed.
- **Cash + UPI one-liner parser** — `"Diya paid 3000 cash 3000 upi"` currently not parsed; only the step-by-step collect-rent form handles split modes today.
- **Cheat sheet enhancement** — prominent "Someone came to pay — where to start" section at top (flows A/B/C exist but are buried).
- 16 state-management golden failures (from prior session, still open).

---

## [1.39.0] — 2026-04-20 (evening) — Disambig audit + sheet auto-refresh + sort

### Added
- **`scripts/sort_monthly_by_checkin.py`** — one-off sorter for every monthly tab. Dynamic header-row detection, per-tab CSV backup in `data/backups/sort_<timestamp>/`, row-count + content-multiset checks post-write, no column truncation. Already run once against DEC 2025 → APRIL 2026 live.
- **`tests/test_disambig_e2e.py`** — end-to-end disambiguation test. Routes messages through `intent_detector → gatekeeper → handler → pending → resolver` for every name-based intent (QUERY_TENANT, PAYMENT_LOG, VOID_PAYMENT, RENT_CHANGE, UPDATE_SHARING/RENT/PHONE, ADD_REFUND, CHECKOUT, ROOM_TRANSFER, ASSIGN_STAFF_ROOM, EXIT_STAFF). Mutating intents are auto-cancelled — safe on live DB. Also probes state-preservation + cancel.
- **`ASSIGN_STAFF_ROOM` / `EXIT_STAFF` intents** — bot commands `staff [name] room [num]`, `staff [name] exit`, `assign staff [name] to [num]`. Many staff per room allowed (no sharing-type enforcement). Auto-flips `Room.is_staff_room` true on assign and back to false only when the last staff leaves.

### Fixed
- **Pending state silently dropped** (`src/whatsapp/chat_api.py:435`) — if a user mid-confirmation sent anything other than the expected choice, `pending.resolved = True` fired with no reply, killing state. Now: cancel keywords (`cancel`/`stop`/`abort`/`quit`/`nevermind`) close pending cleanly; anything else keeps pending alive and falls through to normal intent detection so side-tasks don't nuke confirmation flows.
- **Monthly tab ordering** — `clean_and_load.py`, `create_month.py`, and `reload_april.py` now sort tenants by check-in ascending before writing, so the latest check-in always lands at the bottom. Missing check-ins sink to the top so the real latest stays last.
- **Dashboard banner stale after sharing / rent / checkin change** — API writes don't fire the Apps Script `onEdit` trigger, so banner rows never refreshed after bot writes. Fix is at the gsheets layer: `_update_tenant_field_sync`, `_update_checkin_sync`, `_sync_tenant_all_fields_sync` all call `_refresh_summary_sync` post-write. Covers every caller (field updates, systemic sync, check-in changes); existing refresh in payment_log / add_tenant / record_checkout / record_notice / void_payment unchanged.
- **Silent-pick disambig bugs** uncovered by full audit:
  - `_add_refund` (account_handler) was picking `rows[0]` when multiple active or exited tenants matched the name. Now saves `REFUND_WHO` pending + prompts. `_do_add_refund_by_ids` extracted so the resolver can finish the refund once the user picks.
  - `assign_staff_to_room` was `next((s for s … if s.name.lower() == name.lower()))` — silent first-match when 2+ active staff share a name. Now saves `ASSIGN_STAFF_WHO` pending. `_apply_staff_assignment` extracted.
  - `exit_staff_from_room` was returning a plain text choice list with no pending saved — the user's `1` would route as a fresh intent, not a disambig reply. Now saves `EXIT_STAFF_WHO`; `_apply_staff_exit` extracted.
  - Resolver branches for `ASSIGN_STAFF_WHO`, `EXIT_STAFF_WHO`, `REFUND_WHO` added to `resolve_pending_action` in `owner_handler.py`.

### Verified
- "disha balance" (and any duplicate first-name) path: QUERY_TENANT detects ambiguity, saves pending, shows numbered choices, resolves on `1`/`2`.
- 2 active staff named `zzDupStaff` → `staff zzDupStaff room G05` → disambig pending saved → pick `1` → Manager linked to G05, Security untouched, room flipped to staff.
- Post-write banner refresh recomputes `Active / Beds (X+YP) / Vacant / Occupancy` based on the updated sharing column (`gsheets.py:619` → 2 beds if premium, 1 otherwise).

### Still pending (next session)
- Run `tests/test_disambig_e2e.py` end-to-end and fix any failures before VPS deploy.
- DEPOSIT_CHANGE end-to-end confirmation (audit flagged as OK structurally but not functionally tested).
- Tenant-side pending: `chat_api.py:443` still unconditionally resolves after `resolve_tenant_complaint`; apply the same keep-pending rule if tenant flows grow multi-step.

---

## [1.38.0] — 2026-04-20 — Field registry (Phase 1) + refund audit gap closed

### Added
- **`src/database/field_registry.py`** — single-source-of-truth `FIELDS` tuple of `Field(key, display, source, db_attr, tenants_header, monthly_header, type, options, editable_via_bot, editable_via_form, aliases)` covering every tenant + tenancy attribute visible to the receptionist. 40+ entries. Drives sheet headers, bot→sheet field maps, and (next phase) the `/api/v2/app/field-registry` endpoint for PWA form generation.
- **Derivation helpers** in the registry: `monthly_headers()`, `tenants_headers()`, `tenants_field_to_header()`, `field_to_col()`, `fields_for_pwa()`.
- **Emergency Contact split** — new TENANTS column `"Emergency Contact Phone"` (additive, positioned immediately after `"Emergency Contact"`). `emergency_contact_name` now feeds the legacy `"Emergency Contact"` column (name only; phone moves to new column). Sheet-side change required: add the new column header manually in TENANTS tab — sync skips missing headers gracefully until then.
- **Refund audit gap closed** — `sync_tenant_all_fields` now loads the latest `Refund` row per tenancy and populates `"Refund Status"` + `"Refund Amount"` on the TENANTS tab. Previously those cells stayed blank after any DB mutation even though the columns existed.
- **10 parity + invariant tests** (`tests/test_field_registry.py`) locking in derived outputs against the prior hardcoded constants, uniqueness of keys/headers, and required `db_attr` / `options` on non-computed / select fields.

### Changed
- `src/integrations/gsheets.py`: `MONTHLY_HEADERS`, `TENANTS_HEADERS`, `_TENANTS_FIELD_TO_HEADER`, `_FIELD_TO_COL` now derive from the registry (previously 30+ lines of hardcoded literals). Positional column indices `T_REFUND_STATUS` / `T_REFUND_AMOUNT` / `M_*` unchanged so callers in `owner_handler.py` (refund write path at line 4289) keep working.
- TENANTS tab now has 35 headers (was 34) — single additive column.

### Fixed
- `sync_tenant_all_fields`: `"Emergency Contact"` column was using name-or-phone fallback which conflated two distinct attributes. Now strictly populates name only; phone routes to the dedicated new column.

### Still pending
- Edit `cozeevo_booking_confirmation` body via API once Meta flips it to APPROVED.
- Phase 2 of the registry: `GET /api/v2/app/field-registry` endpoint (~30 min).
- 16 state-management golden failures (from prior session).

---

## [1.37.0] — 2026-04-20 — Checkout + Payment WhatsApp templates wired

### Added
- **`cozeevo_checkout_confirmation` wired into `_do_checkout`** (`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`). Fires template with 5 vars (name, room, checkout date, deposit refund, final balance) as a fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task`; falls back to free-text inside the 24-hr window if template still PENDING at Meta. Net settlement drives `refund` / `balance` formatting — settled case shows `Rs.0 (settled)`.
- **`cozeevo_payment_received` wired into `_do_log_payment_by_ids`** (`src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py`). Fires template with 4 vars (name, period label e.g. "April 2026 rent", paid this month so far, balance remaining) right after the sheet write-back. Balance ≤ 0 renders as `Rs.0 (paid in full)`. Payment mode intentionally omitted — tenants only care about month-paid + balance.

### Status
- All 3 templates (`cozeevo_booking_confirmation`, `cozeevo_checkout_confirmation`, `cozeevo_payment_received`) still PENDING at Meta (~15-60 min typical, submitted 2026-04-19). Free-text fallbacks keep existing 24-hr-window sends working until approval flips.

### Still pending
- Edit the live `cozeevo_booking_confirmation` body via API once Meta flips it to APPROVED (remove rental-agreement line; add call-receptionist number).
- Field registry Phase 1 + 2 (`project_field_registry.md`).
- 16 state-management golden failures (from previous session).

---

## [1.36.0] — 2026-04-19 — Editable onboarding review + Meta templates submitted

### Added
- **Editable review screen** (`static/admin_onboarding.html`). Pending-review sessions now render every KYC + financial field as an inline input (text / number / date / select). Yellow banner reminds the receptionist that changes are tracked.
- **`overrides` parameter** on `POST /api/onboarding/{token}/approve`. 16 KYC + 5 financial keys supported; backend applies them to `Tenant` / `Tenancy` / `OnboardingSession` before creating records.
- **Diff notification to tenant** — if the receptionist modifies any tenant-submitted value during review, a follow-up free-text WhatsApp message lists exactly the changed fields (old → new) with a call-receptionist fallback. Sent right after the booking-confirmation template so the 24-hr window is already open.
- **AuditLog per overridden field** — `source="onboarding_review"`, `changed_by="receptionist"`, one entry per change, links to tenant / tenancy entity.
- **`cozeevo_booking_confirmation` now 5 vars** — added Deposit as {{5}}. Code path at `src/api/onboarding_router.py::approve_session` passes both rent and deposit values.
- **`WHATSAPP_WABA_ID=1026995743235229`** persisted to `.env` on both local and VPS.

### Submitted to Meta (PENDING review)
- `cozeevo_booking_confirmation` (Template ID `1303194515065555`) — 5 vars. NOTE: submitted body still has the old "rental agreement" line; once Meta approves, edit via `POST /v21.0/1303194515065555` with the corrected body in `docs/WHATSAPP_TEMPLATES.md`.
- `cozeevo_checkout_confirmation` (Template ID `1313261294060481`) — 5 vars, review/return-visit messaging.
- `cozeevo_payment_received` (Template ID `2454482531646516`) — 4 vars, no payment-mode, focuses on "paid this month" + balance.

### Fixed
- `approveSession()` in admin UI now harvests edited inputs via `collectOverrides(token)` helper and sends them in the approve POST body.

### Commits
- `a6afbfa` → `879f3bb` — one-shot WABA capture and cleanup
- `b69e6cc` — editable review form + diff message

### Still pending (next session)
- Edit the live `cozeevo_booking_confirmation` body via API once Meta flips it to APPROVED (remove rental-agreement line; add call-receptionist number).
- Wire `cozeevo_checkout_confirmation` into `_do_checkout`.
- Wire `cozeevo_payment_received` into `_do_log_payment_by_ids`.
- Field registry Phase 1 + 2 (`project_field_registry.md`).

## [1.35.0] — 2026-04-19 — Systemic DB → Sheet invariant + architecture cleanup

### Added
- **Deposit column + Rent column** on every monthly sheet tab. First-month `Rent Due = agreed_rent + security_deposit`; booking advance counted in Total Paid. Enforced in `scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py` + `gsheets._add_tenant_sync`.
- **`sync_tenant_all_fields(tenant_id)`** helper in `src/integrations/gsheets.py` — single entry-point that reads a tenant's full DB state and pushes every visible column to BOTH the TENANTS master tab and the current monthly tab in one batch per sheet. Rule: DB and sheet must never diverge. Wired into all 4 previously-uncovered mutation sites (onboarding KYC, extra-deposit add at room transfer, overpayment → deposit, CONFIRM_ADD_TENANT KYC extras).
- **`trigger_monthly_sheet_sync(month, year)`** + **`update_tenants_tab_field(room, name, field, value)`** helpers in gsheets.py — instant per-cell writes (~1s) for deposit/rent changes plus a background full re-sync for ripple effects. Bot reply returns immediately.
- **`cozeevo_checkout_confirmation`** template spec in `docs/WHATSAPP_TEMPLATES.md` (5 vars). Extended `cozeevo_booking_confirmation` to 5 vars (adds Deposit + modified-field reconciliation note).
- **Instant sheet update** on `_do_deposit_change` and `_do_rent_change` (both monthly-tab cell and TENANTS-tab cell fire as `asyncio.create_task`).
- **AuditLog at all 4 return paths** of `_do_rent_change` (was silent — no accountability trail).
- **EDIT_NOTES** now writes AuditLog + syncs to BOTH tabs (was TENANTS-only).
- **`_locate_monthly_header(all_vals)`** helper in gsheets.py — replaces 6 hardcoded `range(4, len(all_vals))` / `all_vals[3]` sites that broke on tabs created by sync_sheet_from_db.py (header at row 7, not row 4). Checkout, notice, checkin-date, void-payment, update-tenant-field, notes-update all now work on both layouts.

### Changed (Apps Script v5 — header-driven rewrite)
- `scripts/gsheet_apps_script.js` → every read/write now uses header-name lookup via `_findRow_` / `_colMap_` / `_col_`. Dashboard reads correct columns regardless of layout drift.
- `onSheetEdit` no-ops on new 7-row-header layout (was overwriting summary rows 2-6 with the legacy 2-row summary, corrupting the cards).
- `updateMonthSummary`, `getTotalDeposit_`, `validateTotals`, `createMonthTab` all header-driven; old positional indices removed.

### Fixed
- **Sharing type** now auto-fills from `room.room_type` when the onboarding form doesn't explicitly set it. Backfilled the 2 existing NULL rows (Pooja + Arun → double). Fix in `src/api/onboarding_router.py::approve_session`.
- **No-shows** now appear only in their own check-in month, never carried forward to past/future tabs. Enforced in `sync_sheet_from_db.py` section-1 filter.
- **Pooja TENANTS deposit stale** — Lokesh changed 6,750→6,500 at 18:02 via bot; TENANTS tab retained 6,750 until the sync-to-both-tabs wiring shipped. Backfilled via SQL + new propagation ensures this class of bug is eliminated.

### Memory
- New rule: `feedback_db_sheet_invariant.md` — DB mutation → `sync_tenant_all_fields` must fire.
- Updated `feedback_deposit_dues_logic.md` with "first month = rent + deposit − advance" and enforcement locations.
- New project: `project_field_registry.md` — planned Phase-1 refactor for PWA readiness.
- New project: `project_booking_diff_notification.md` — flag receptionist modifications to tenant.

### Commits (all deployed to VPS)
- `b8a9345` `_refresh_summary_sync` header detection + building/no-show parsing
- `ea21409` Deposit column + first-month dues + instant sync trigger
- `2f05144` Rent column + restrict no-shows to checkin month
- `2b2d56b` Instant sheet update on deposit/rent + auto sharing_type
- `0515de4` Deposit/rent change propagates to TENANTS master tab
- `d736d0b` Header-driven sheets everywhere + end-to-end gap closure
- `3c27560` `sync_tenant_all_fields` — systemic DB → sheet invariant

### User actions required (manual)
- Register `cozeevo_booking_confirmation` (5 vars) in Meta Business Manager
- Register `cozeevo_checkout_confirmation` (new spec) when ready
- Apps Script v5 pasted into Cozeevo Operations v2 → Extensions → Apps Script (DONE per Kiran)

## [1.34.1] — 2026-04-19 — Missing-resolver audit (Lokesh incident)

### Fixed
- `DEPOSIT_CHANGE_WHO` — numeric disambiguation ("1 or 2") silently killed pending. Resolver was never wired (pre-existing since `2959c0f`). Lokesh hit this in production 18:03 IST. Fix in commit `bcbccbf`.
- `ROOM_TRANSFER_WHO` + `ROOM_TRANSFER_DEST` — same missing-resolver bug class; both saved via `_save_pending` but had no branch in `resolve_pending_action`. Extracted `_finalize_room_transfer()` helper to share the validate-destination/check-vacancy/save-confirm tail across all entry paths. Fix in commit `f977e7b`.
- Both intents added to the cancel-list so "no" aborts cleanly.

### Audit
Grep of every `_save_pending(intent)` call vs every `pending.intent ==` resolver:
- 33 intents saved. All 33 now have a resolver (owner_handler cascade × 29, chat_api early dispatch × 4).
- Zero remaining gaps of the "save pending, never resolve" bug class.

### Verification status
Ran golden suite (73/100 pass) against live local API + TEST_MODE=1. 27 failures remain, of which 16 are state-management (correction_mid_flow × 7, state_guard × 6, ambiguous_name × 3). Same bug class as Lokesh's, but triggered by different handlers — scheduled for next session's triage (see `memory/project_pending_tasks.md` top section).

### Lessons
- Added `memory/feedback_pattern_generalize.md` — when one handler has bug X, grep for X across all handlers before claiming fix. Triggered by overclaim that "state management is there" when only 5 of ~33 intents were ported to the framework.

## [1.34.0] — 2026-04-19 — Owner PWA Foundation (Plan 1 · partial)

### Brainstorm → Spec → Plan
- Brainstormed full vision for Owner PWA (mobile-first, voice-first, complements WhatsApp bot, evolves into Kozzy SaaS)
- Locked 7 design principles (numbers-hero, speed-over-beauty, fool-proof-by-structure, voice-first, one-screen-one-answer, thumb-reachable, trust-signals)
- Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-owner-pwa-design.md` (16 sections: purpose, users, scope, architecture, voice pipeline, security, home screen, design system, build sequence, existing-rules alignment, mockup-before-build cadence)
- Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-owner-pwa-foundation.md` (25 tasks across 6 phases for weeks 1-2; Plans 2+3 written after Plan 1 ships)
- Decomposition: PWA → 3 plans (Foundation+Rent / Modifications+Check-in / Check-out+Comms+Polish) — each produces working software

### Backend (FastAPI · `src/`)
- **Services layer** (`src/services/`): lifted `log_payment` from WhatsApp handler into `payments.py` + `audit.py` — shared single source of truth for bot + PWA. `PaymentResult` expanded with `status`/`effective_due`/`total_paid` so handler drops redundant re-queries. 11/11 tests pass. Commits `e818c33`, `650ddf7`.
- **Multi-tenant data model** (`src/database/migrations/add_org_id_2026_04_19.py`): added `org_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1` to 8 tables (tenancies, payments, rooms, rent_revisions, rent_schedule, expenses, leads, audit_log). Idempotent, SQLite+Postgres, per-table index `idx_<table>_org_id`. ORM `index=True` dropped (migration is source of truth). Cozeevo = org_id 1. 4/4 tests pass. Commits `d410166`, `110303e`.
- **New API surface** (`src/api/v2/app_router.py`): `/api/v2/app/*` router with Supabase JWT middleware (HS256, audience=authenticated). `get_current_user` dependency returns `AppUser(user_id, phone, role, org_id)`. Generic "invalid token" 401 message (server-side logs the real error). Defensive `int()` on `org_id`. `/health` endpoint. `LocalOnlyMiddleware` whitelist for `/api/v2/app` (JWT replaces localhost restriction for public-facing mobile API). 8/8 tests pass. Commits `dca0a1f`, `7c2fb68`.

### Frontend (PWA · `/web/`)
- **Next.js 15 scaffold** (`cd9d5ac`, `ffc2089`): App Router + TypeScript strict + Tailwind + Serwist PWA service worker + manifest (name "Kozzy · Cozeevo Help Desk", theme `#EF1F9C`, bg `#F6F5F0`). PIL-generated icon-192/512 placeholders. DM Sans (weights 400-800) via `next/font/google`. `lib/format.ts` with Indian number grouping (₹2,40,000). 4/4 Vitest tests pass. Clean build (104kB first load JS).
- **Design tokens** (`web/tailwind.config.ts`): brand colors + pastel tiles + status colors + borderRadius (card/tile/pill).
- **Playwright verification**: PWA boots at http://localhost:3100, renders pink K logo on cream bg with correct Indian rupee formatting. Screenshot: `.playwright-mcp/pwa-scaffold-first-boot.png`.

### Process / memory
- Subagent-driven-development workflow: per-task implementer + spec-compliance review + code-quality review, applied loops for fixes. ~10 subagent dispatches total.
- Saved memory: UI approval + interactive Playwright testing requirement, test-data isolation (never write to live Cozeevo DB), PWA tech-debt backlog, updated pending-tasks list.

### Known follow-ups (deferred, documented)
- PWA: Tailwind semantic token rename, manifest `purpose` fix, `.gitignore` PNG negation, favicon, role vocabulary alignment — see `memory/project_pwa_tech_debt.md`.
- Plan 1 remaining: Tasks 4 (payments endpoint), 5 (collection endpoint), 6 (Supabase dashboard — manual), 9 (UI primitives), 10 (Supabase client), 11 (Login screen with mockup gate).

## [1.33.0] — 2026-04-18 — Rent Reconciliation + Data Architecture

### Rent Reconciliation (drop + reload)
- Wiped L1+L2 data (payments, rent_schedule, tenancies, tenants) — L0 preserved
- Re-imported Jan-Mar from Cozeevo Monthly stay.xlsx (294 tenants, 1014 payments)
- Re-imported April from April Month Collection.xlsx (239 payments)
- DB now matches Excel exactly for Cash + UPI per month
- Fixed `excel_import.py` phone constraint — partners sharing phone allowed (was failing on unique constraint)
- Confirmed: **zero duplicates in DB** (exact-match grouping on tenancy + date + amount + mode + for_type + notes)

### Documentation
- `docs/RENT_RECONCILIATION.md` — 7-step monthly process (Excel ↔ DB ↔ Bank), anti-duplicate rule, Chandra off-book tracking (Mar 1.6L + Apr 15.5K)
- `docs/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md` — canonical data model (L0-L3 layers), 6 golden rules, ETL flow, 6-step migration plan from hardcoded columns → Pydantic schemas

### Cash Report Tool
- `scripts/cash_report.py` — DB cash by month filtered by for_type (rent/deposit/booking)
- Prevents inflation from counting deposits as cash (was 3-5x inflated before)

### Feedback Memory
- `feedback_no_false_alarms.md` — never claim DB duplicates without exact-match grouping (incl. for_type + notes); rent reports must filter for_type='rent'

## [1.32.0] — 2026-04-17 — Payment Audit Trails + Bank Statement P&L

### Payment Flow Improvements
- Over/underpayment now prompts for notes (free-text reason)
- Overpayment: added option 4 "Add a note" alongside advance/deposit/ask tenant
- Underpayment: asks for note after logging partial payment (reply or "skip")
- Audit log entries for every payment creation and void (who, amount, room, timestamp)
- AuditLog import added to account_handler

### Bank Statement Classification
- New CSV reader for YES Bank CSV format (Statement-*.csv)
- Fixed duplicate Jan 2026 data (Excel + CSV overlap)
- Fixed misclassification: Rs.6L RTGS to Sri Lakshmi Chandrasekar was "Bank Charges" → now "Property Rent"
- Added classification rules: carpenter, fridge, bleaching powder, drumstick, batter, Jio/Airtel/Vi recharges, police, tenant refund names
- `pnl_report.py` rewritten: uses shared `pnl_classify.py` rules, reads all sources (Excel + CSV), no duplicate rules
- `export_classified.py`: added CSV reader, P&L sheet includes income + expenses + net profit
- `classify_new_statement.py`: standalone classifier for quick runs
- Output: `PnL_Report.xlsx` (3 sheets: P&L Summary, Income Detail, Expense Detail)

### P&L Summary (Oct 2025 – Mar 2026)
- Total Income: Rs.91.8L | Total Expenses: Rs.91.2L | Net: +Rs.57K
- 70 unclassified transactions (Rs.4.4L) — generic UPI with no description

## [1.31.0] — 2026-04-16 — Day-wise Onboarding + Consistency Audit

### Day-wise Onboarding (NEW)
- Admin form: Stay Type toggle (Monthly/Daily) — daily shows checkout date, num days, daily rate
- Approve branches: daily → DaywiseStay DB + DAY WISE sheet; monthly → Tenancy + TENANTS + monthly tab
- `add_daywise_stay()` in gsheets.py — header-based mapping to DAY WISE tab
- Migration: added checkout_date, num_days, daily_rate to onboarding_sessions table
- Both paths share: tenant creation, selfie/ID/signature, PDF, WhatsApp

### Consistency Audit (3 parallel agents)
- **Day-wise:** Was not wired — dropdown existed but approve always created monthly Tenancy. Fixed.
- **Dues:** tenant_handler.py MY_BALANCE ignores prev_due (bug noted, fix next session)
- **Bot path:** DB keeps deposit separate (correct for accounting), Sheet combines (correct for receptionist)

## [1.30.0] — 2026-04-16 — Dues Logic + Monthly Rollover + Sheet Consistency

### Dues Calculation (FINAL)
- First month: Rent Due = rent + deposit (deposit includes maintenance, no double count)
- Month 2+: Rent Due = rent only, Prev Due carries unpaid balance
- Balance = Rent Due + Prev Due - Total Paid (consistent everywhere)
- Notes auto-populated with "Deposit due: Rs.X" for first-month check-ins
- No separate Deposit Due column — 17-column format preserved
- Maintenance never in dues — only relevant at checkout/refund

### Monthly Tab Rollover (NEW)
- `scripts/create_month.py` rewritten: header-based mapping, 17-col format, prev due carry-forward
- Auto-scheduled on 1st of every month at 12:30am via `_monthly_tab_rollover` in scheduler
- Only active + no-show tenants carried (exited excluded)
- Auto-note "Deposit due: Rs.X pending" when deposit unpaid from previous month
- First month check-ins get prorated rent + deposit in Rent Due

### Sheet Consistency Fixes
- Removed hardcoded column indices from `_refresh_summary_sync` — now uses derived M_* constants
- Phone format: +91XXXXXXXXXX for all onboarding writes
- Sheet retry: 3 attempts with 2s/4s backoff on approve (was fire-and-forget)
- `saved_files` key fix (was `_saved_files` — stripped by JSON serializer)
- Cleaned test data from DB

### Onboarding Fixes
- Filterable sessions table (status + date range) replaces static stats
- Lightbox for selfie/ID/signature — click to enlarge, Escape to close
- Camera selfie with face oval guide, fallback to file picker
- Selfie/ID/signature all mandatory before submit
- Mobile scroll fix on Step 5

## [1.29.0] — 2026-04-16 — Live Onboarding Testing + Security + UX Fixes

### Admin Panel
- PIN authentication on all admin endpoints (env: `ONBOARDING_ADMIN_PIN`)
- Room auto-lookup from master data when typing room number
- Sharing type dropdown with premium option + master data mismatch warning
- Live dues calculator (rent + deposit - advance)
- Filterable sessions table (status, date range) replaces static stats
- Lightbox for selfie/ID/signature — click to enlarge, Escape to close
- Cancel and Resend WhatsApp Link buttons
- Default reception phone 8548884455
- Stats refresh on Refresh button

### Tenant Form
- Live camera selfie with face oval guide (getUserMedia API), fallback to file picker
- Selfie, ID proof, signature all mandatory before submit
- Fixed selfie preview ID bug (`selfie-preview` vs `selfie-preview-wrap`)
- Fixed mobile scroll on Step 5 (terms box 30vh, body padding)
- Fixed camera modal showing before permission granted (prevented black screen freeze)
- Outer try-catch on submit to show errors instead of freezing
- Late payment penalty updated to Rs.200/day after 5th

### Security
- Admin PIN auth on all `/api/onboarding/admin/*` endpoints
- Rate limiting: create 10/min, submit 5/min, token lookup 20/min, room lookup 30/min
- File upload size limit: 5MB per file
- Generic error messages to prevent token enumeration
- 2-hour form expiry (was 48 hours)
- One-time use: form rejects resubmission after status change

### Flow Improvements
- WhatsApp notification to receptionist when tenant submits form
- WhatsApp message to tenant includes full booking summary + dues
- Auto-cancel old pending sessions when creating new one for same phone
- Deposit includes maintenance — no double counting in dues
- Fixed `_saved_files` key stripped by JSON serializer (renamed to `saved_files`)
- Middleware updated: admin panel + all onboarding APIs publicly accessible

### Deployed to VPS
- reportlab installed, migrations run, service active

## [1.28.0] — 2026-04-15 — Digital Onboarding Form + 12 Checkin Fixes + Column Mapping

### Digital Onboarding Form (NEW)
- **Architecture:** Two-form system — receptionist creates session, tenant fills on phone, receptionist approves
- New `OnboardingSession` model extended with token, status, room/rent fields, signature, PDF path
- API router: `/api/onboarding/create`, `/{token}`, `/{token}/submit`, `/admin/pending`, `/{token}/approve`
- Tenant mobile form: 5-step wizard (Personal → Family → Address → ID → Agreement + Signature)
- Admin panel: create sessions, review queue, approve flow
- PDF agreement generator using reportlab (branded, with embedded signature)
- WhatsApp document sending helper added
- Middleware updated: `/onboard/*` and tenant API endpoints are public
- Step-by-step WhatsApp checkin flow removed (replaced by digital form)

### 12 Checkin Flow Fixes
1. Food step wired into photo checkin flow via `_next_form_step` + `ask_food_form` handler
2. Cash/UPI prompt: always asked when advance > 0, never defaulted to cash
3. Office phone doubling fixed in KYC display
4. Monthly tab refactored to header-based mapping (same as TENANTS)
5. Phone/ID fields: apostrophe prefix preserves format in Sheet
6. Event column: "CHECKIN" populated on add
7. Entered By column: "bot", "onboarding_form", "excel_load" (not phone numbers)
8. Building auto-lookup: already working from room→property join
9. NO-SHOW auto-flip: startup task flips no_show→active when checkin_date arrives
10. Haiku OCR: room numbering corrected (THOR=01-12, HULK=13-24)
11. Age field: asked after DOB if DOB skipped (stored in notes)
12. Advance reflected in monthly tab (Cash/UPI column + calculated balance/status)

### Column Mapping System
- `MONTHLY_HEADERS` and `TENANTS_HEADERS` canonical lists (single source of truth)
- `_build_header_map()` and `_header_index()` helpers
- T_*/M_* constants auto-derived from header lists via `_derive_constants()`
- `clean_and_load.py` imports canonical headers (no more duplicated lists)
- Removed duplicate T_* constants at end of gsheets.py that overwrote TENANTS indices
- Emergency Contact field mapping fixed (was swapped)
- April+ monthly tabs use new 17-column format in clean_and_load.py

### Known Issues
- Digital form needs browser testing with real token flow
- PDF generation not yet tested with real signature data
- VPS deploy pending (needs `pip install reportlab` + migration)

## [1.27.0] — 2026-04-15 — RLS + Photo Checkin Improvements + Sheet Header Mapping

### Security
- Enabled RLS on 42/43 public tables via `migrate_all.py` (runs every migration)
- Only `pg_config` (Postgres system view) excluded

### Photo Checkin Flow
- Added advance payment step: bot asks "any advance paid?" after gender
- Edit colon parsing fixed: `edit room : 609` now works correctly
- `_next_form_step` helper started (food → advance → sharing chain, WIP)

### Sheet Sync
- TENANTS tab writes now use header-based column mapping (not positional)
- Prevents data shift when columns are reordered or added

### Infrastructure
- `simplify_roles` migration wrapped in try/except (non-fatal on Supabase timeout)
- Manual tenant insert: G.D. Abhishek to room 609 (THOR, premium)

### Known Issues (queued for next session)
- Food preference not asked in photo checkin flow (partially coded)
- Cash/UPI not asked for advance payments
- Office phone shows twice in confirmation display
- Monthly tab still uses positional array (needs header mapping)
- Phone/ID format inconsistency in Sheet

## [1.26.0] — 2026-04-13 — Room Ops + Sheet Sync + Unhandled Logging

### Added
- **ASSIGN_ROOM intent** — assign rooms to unassigned/future bookings, blocks if already active, fuzzy name match with phone confirmation
- **QUERY_UNHANDLED intent** — "show unhandled requests" shows messages bot couldn't understand
- **`unhandled_requests` table** — logs every UNKNOWN intent with phone, message, role for future intent building
- **Sheet retry queue** — failed Sheet writes saved to `data/sheet_write_queue.json`, retried on bot startup
- **`scripts/sync_sheet_from_db.py`** — full DB-to-Sheet reconciliation (active + noshow only, no stale exits)
- **Gender always required** during form image checkin (asks if not found in image)

### Enhanced
- **ROOM_TRANSFER** — shows who occupies target room (name + phone) instead of generic "choose vacant room"; adds Sheet sync + audit log
- **Staff rooms regex** — now matches "staff rooms", "how many staff rooms", "labour rooms", "labor room"
- **SCHEDULE_CHECKOUT** — catches "leaving tomorrow/today/next week" (was falling through to CHECKOUT)

### Fixed
- **Sheet synced to DB** — April tab now matches: 261 beds, 15 no-show, 14 vacant. Removed 59 stale EXIT + 11 CANCELLED rows
- **Unicode in migrate_all.py** — arrow chars caused cp1252 errors on Windows

## [1.25.1] — 2026-04-12 — April Import + Vacant Beds Fix

### Fixed
- **Vacant beds calculation** — was using broken summary formula (showed 4 instead of 27). Now uses room-by-room count: skips premium rooms, subtracts active + noshow + daywise per room. Single source of truth.
- **Import script** — placeholder phone collision for tenants already imported with NOPHONE prefix

### Added
- **April 2026 data imported** — 324 rows from Excel, 19 new tenants created, 247 rent schedules + 235 payments loaded
- **Error recovery guidance** — "try again or type hi to start fresh" instead of just "something went wrong"

## [1.25.0] — 2026-04-11 — Audit Trail + Rent Revisions + Sheet Protection

### Added
- **`audit_log` table** — immutable trail for all field changes (who, when, old→new, room, source)
- **`rent_revisions` table** — rent change history with effective dates, reason, and who authorized
- **Audit logging** wired into all update handlers (sharing_type, rent, phone, gender, deposit, room AC/maintenance/staff)
- **Deposit change** (`account_handler._do_deposit_change`) now writes audit log
- **Sharing type → rent prompt** — after confirming sharing type change, bot asks "want to update rent too?"
- **`QUERY_AUDIT` intent** — "show changes for Anukriti", "who changed room 402", "audit log"
- **`QUERY_RENT_HISTORY` intent** — "rent history Anukriti", "show rent changes"
- **`QUERY_STAFF_ROOMS` intent** — "list staff rooms", "non-revenue rooms"
- **Staff room toggle** — "room G05 staff room" / "room 305 not staff" (with audit)
- **`lockAllSheets()` function** in Apps Script — protects all Sheet tabs, bot-only edits
- **Sheet locked via API** — all 10 tabs protected programmatically

### Fixed
- **Rent vs payment disambiguation** — "Anukriti rent 28000" no longer matches UPDATE_RENT (requires explicit keywords like change/update/set). Prevents confusion with payment collection.
- **Removed duplicate UPDATE_DEPOSIT** intent — DEPOSIT_CHANGE in account_handler already handles this
- **Anukriti rent corrected** — updated from 15,000 (old double rate) to 28,000 (premium rate) in DB + Sheet
- **Saurabh Kumar 406 Sheet fix** — reverted manual edit (rent_due 123 → 15,500)
- **Inactive room lookup** — room update handler now finds inactive rooms for "maintenance done" commands

### Documented
- **Data sync policy** (BRAIN.md §15b) — DB is source of truth, bot-only changes, Sheet is read-only mirror
- **Data sync rule** added to CLAUDE.md dependency checklist

## [1.24.0] — 2026-04-10 — Media Upload Handler + Receipt Collection

### Added
- **Media upload handler** (`receipt_handler.py`) — classifies uploaded photos by caption keywords and routes to appropriate handler
- **Receipt types:** payment receipt, expense bill, tenant ID proof, license/certificate, vendor delivery slip
- **Payment receipt flow:** auto-attach to recent payment, disambiguate if multiple, ask user if no context
- **Photo-first flow:** receipt saved, bot asks for payment details to link it
- **Document archive:** all uploads stored in `documents` table with type tagging
- **`receipt_url`** column on payments table — links payment to receipt image
- **Pending states:** RECEIPT_SELECT, MEDIA_CLASSIFY, RECEIPT_NO_PAYMENT for multi-turn flows

### Next
- **Gemini Vision** — free multimodal AI to auto-read receipt images (amount, UPI ref, tenant name). Kiran getting API key.

## [1.23.0] — 2026-04-10 — Flexible NL Queries + Conversation Memory + Regex Fixes

### Added
- **Flexible natural language queries** — ask any data question in plain English via WhatsApp. LLM generates SQL from DB schema, executes safely, and formats reply naturally. Examples: "top 5 highest paying tenants", "average rent per building", "which tenants haven't paid"
- **LLM-formatted replies** — query results are summarized by LLM into clean WhatsApp messages instead of raw data dumps
- **Conversation history** — last 8 messages loaded as context for PydanticAI agent. Follow-up queries work: "how many female tenants" → "break it down by building"
- **Query logging** — every flexible query saved to classification_log for learning and audit
- **Guardrails** — non-PG questions rejected, SELECT-only, table whitelist, row limits

### Fixed
- **Regex: void expense** — no longer matches VOID_PAYMENT (required 'payment' keyword)
- **Regex: complaint status** — no longer matches QUERY_TENANT (word boundary fix)
- **Regex: void last payment** — now correctly matches VOID_PAYMENT
- **SQL validator** — EXTRACT(FROM col) no longer blocked as table reference
- 30/30 regex intent tests pass with zero LLM calls

### Architecture
- `src/llm_gateway/agents/flexible_query.py` — new flexible query engine
- `QUERY_FLEXIBLE` intent added to PydanticAI prompt builder
- Short-term memory (chat_messages), long-term (property_config + intent_examples + classification_log)
- Vector DB (pgvector/RAG) planned for receipts/bills collection phase

## [1.22.0] — 2026-04-09 — PydanticAI Enabled + Vacant Beds Accuracy + Data Cleanup

### Added
- **PydanticAI enabled** — `USE_PYDANTIC_AGENTS=true`, handles UNKNOWN/GENERAL intents with structured LLM output, few-shot examples, confidence routing
- **Day-wise stays** in occupancy — short-stay guests now subtracted from available beds (auto-expires on checkout_date)
- **ANOMALIES sheet** — auto-generated in Google Sheet with 76 data quality issues (wrong PAID status, negative balances, date mismatches)

### Fixed
- **Vacant beds handler** — now shows ALL empty beds (partial + fully vacant rooms), not just fully vacant rooms
- **Occupancy handler** — includes day-wise line item
- **Monthly report** — total_beds from DB (not hardcoded 291), building vacant counts partials
- **Gender filter** — accounts for day-wise occupants
- **Balance clamp** — negative balances clamped to 0 on Sheet (deposit+rent = PAID, not -12000). Both gsheets.py and Apps Script
- **ORM UUID types** — String(36) → PostgreSQL UUID to match Supabase schema

### Removed
- **LangGraph v2** — deleted `src/whatsapp/v2/` (dead code, replaced by PydanticAI). Removed langgraph, langchain, langchain-core, langchain-groq from requirements

### Data
- Synced 14 no-show→active tenancies (Sheet said CHECKIN, DB said no_show)
- Cancelled Chinmay Pagey stale no-show (had active tenancy in different room)
- Cancelled Shalini (not on April Sheet)
- Remaining no-shows: 7 (all genuine, confirmed against Sheet)
- SSH key auth configured for VPS deploys

### Open
- **76 anomalies** on ANOMALIES sheet — Kiran reviewing (34 PAID-but-underpaid, 38 negative balances, 4 date mismatches)
- **Natural language flexible queries** via PydanticAI — not yet implemented (next session)
- **DB/Sheet full re-sync** — waiting for Kiran's updated data

## [1.21.2] — 2026-04-08 — Phone Dedup Fix + April Sheet Sync

### Fixed
- **Phone dedup bug** — `excel_import.py` used phone-only as tenant cache key, causing shared-phone roommates (e.g. V. Bhanu Prakash + V. Sathya Priya in room 314) to be skipped. Now uses phone+name.
- **import_april.py** — same phone+name matching for shared phones. Created V. Bhanu Prakash + Sanskar Bharadia who were previously missing.
- **April Sheet format** — rewrote to 17-col format (with Phone column) matching gsheets.py. Was 15-col hybrid that broke bot write-back and Apps Script dashboard.
- **April Sheet statuses** — uses Excel statuses directly instead of recalculating from Cash+UPI (which missed advance payments and cross-month balances).

### Data
- DB + Sheet now in sync: Rs 34,77,707 total April collections
- 8 missing April rent_schedules generated, Adithya Reddy marked exit
- Dashboard summary rows 2-3 now auto-generated with correct occupancy/collection stats

### Open
- 9 UNPAID showing on Sheet vs expected 5 checked-in unpaid — needs investigation (some may be no-shows miscategorized)

## [1.21.1] — 2026-04-08 — Report Revamp + April Delta Update + Groq 429 Fix

### Fixed
- **Groq 429 fallback** — `_call_llm_manual` now returns graceful "try again" reply instead of crashing on rate limit. Also handles JSON parse errors.

### Changed
- **Monthly report** — Total Collection = Rent + Maintenance (per REPORTING.md). Security Deposits shown as separate line. Rent breakdown shows Cash/UPI split.
- **Yearly report** — same: maintenance + deposits tracked per month, totals include maintenance in collection.

### Added
- **`scripts/update_april_delta.py`** — delta updater: compares Excel vs DB per-tenant, only updates changed records (payments, statuses, notes). No more drop-and-reload for incremental updates.
- **April import columns** — complaints (col 26), vacation (col 27) now parsed from Excel.

### Data
- April delta applied: +20 payments, 4 corrected, 21 status updates, 11 notes synced, 3 new tenants (Kiran Koushik, Nihanth, Prableen). DB total matches Excel: Rs 34,77,707.

## [1.21.0] — 2026-04-08 — Kozzy AI Platform: PydanticAI + Multi-Tenant Foundation

### Added
- **PydanticAI ConversationAgent** — structured LLM output, few-shot examples, natural conversation, confidence routing (>0.9 execute / 0.6-0.9 options / <0.6 clarify)
- **LearningAgent** — background async learning from corrections, selections, confirmations. Each PG learns independently.
- **property_config table** — multi-tenant config: buildings, rooms, pricing, bank config, personality per PG
- **intent_examples table** — self-learning intent database, scoped per PG, grows from user interactions
- **classification_log table** — audit trail of every intent classification
- **Dynamic system prompt** — built from property_config, role-aware, with injected few-shot examples
- **Feature flag** — `USE_PYDANTIC_AGENTS=false` for safe rollout, instant rollback
- **Cozeevo seeded** as first PG tenant (PG_ID: 58373135-5a92-4957-b11e-256d61f09441)
- **SYSTEM_SPEC.md** — single-file platform specification (14 sections, replaces reading 16 docs)

### Fixed
- **pg_config name conflict** — PostgreSQL has a system view called pg_config. Renamed to property_config.
- **PydanticAI API** — output_type (not result_type), result.output (not result.data)

### Architecture
- Regex stays as fast path (~97%). PydanticAI handles misses with structured output.
- Every LLM classification feeds the learning flywheel (intent_examples grows autonomously).
- All PG-specific config in property_config — no hardcoded strings in agent code.
- Handlers unchanged — agents output same dict shape, zero handler modifications.

### Smoke Test Results
- "Raj paid 15000" → PAYMENT_LOG (conf=0.95) ✓
- "Good morning!" → natural reply ✓
- "Who are you?" → "I'm Cozeevo Help Desk..." ✓

## [1.20.0] — 2026-04-08 — Confirm Bug Fix + Contact Management + Benchmarks

### Fixed (CRITICAL)
- **Confirm steps broken for 2+ days** — `return None` at line 2542 in `resolve_pending_action` killed ALL text-based confirm flows (Yes/No). Every intent after that line was unreachable. Fixed with `chosen is not None` guards.
- **Webhook dedup** — Meta sends 4-5 duplicate POSTs per message. Added in-memory msg_id cache (60s TTL) to skip duplicates.
- **`_save_pending` import missing** — `resolve_pending_action` didn't import `_save_pending`, crashing all multi-step flows.
- **Add Contact intent routing** — "Add building electrician contact" was matching QUERY_CONTACTS instead of ADD_CONTACT.
- **Phone parsing** — strips spaces, +91 prefix, saves 10-digit only.
- **Category matching** — word boundary regex prevents "contact" matching "ac" → false "AC Service".

### Added
- **Add Contact notes step** — asks "Any notes?" after category, saved to `contact_for` field.
- **Update Contact command** — "update contact Shiva", "change Balu number", "edit plumber notes".
- **Contact query filtering** — "send me electrician vinays contact" now returns only Vinay, not all electricians.
- **VPS file-based logging** — `/tmp/pg_pending_debug.log` for tracing pending flows (journald doesn't work with uvicorn workers).

### Benchmarked
- 115 test cases: Regex 76.5%, Haiku 94.8%, Groq ~90%
- Switched back to Groq (free) — Haiku cost $1+ in 2 days
- **Next: PydanticAI integration** — structured output, self-correcting, learning flywheel

## [1.19.0] — 2026-04-07 — April Import + Day-wise Stays

### Added
- **`scripts/import_april.py`** — April payment drop-and-reload importer from `April Month Collection.xlsx`
  - Reads all rows (CHECKIN, NO SHOW, EXIT with payments), creates missing tenants/tenancies
  - Extracts pure numeric from cash/UPI/balance cols; text saved as April notes
  - Permanent comments → tenancy.notes, monthly comments → rent_schedule.notes
  - Drop + reload safe (idempotent). Verified: Cash 7,44,050 + UPI 25,28,575 = 32,72,625 exact match
- **`scripts/import_daywise.py`** — Day-wise short-stay importer merging both Excel files
  - Reads "Daily Basis" (main Excel) + "Day wise" (April Excel), deduplicates by SHA-256
  - 93 unique records, 88 inserted to DB, revenue 2,18,950
  - New "DAY WISE" tab on Google Sheet
- **`daywise_stays` DB table** — separate table for short-term guests (1-10 days), not in tenancy chain
- **APRIL 2026 Google Sheet tab** — 234 rows with formulas, balance column as notes

### Changed
- `src/database/models.py` — added DaywiseStay model
- `src/database/migrate_all.py` — added daywise_stays CREATE TABLE

## [1.18.1] — 2026-04-06 — Critical Fix: Pending State + Conversation Flow

### Fixed
- **ROOT CAUSE: chat_messages table missing on VPS** — `_save_chat_message` in same transaction as pending actions caused commit rollback, losing ALL pending state (confirm steps never worked)
- **Fix: separate commits** — critical ops (pending, payments) commit first; chat messages in separate try/except commit
- **"No" during confirm** → now asks "what to change?" instead of cancelling (payment, expense, contact, tenant)
- **Contact name truncation** — "Mahadevapura lineman" no longer stripped to "Mahadevapura" (category keywords kept in name)
- **Pending alive after correction** — updates existing pending in-place instead of creating new record

### Important
- **Always run `python -m src.database.migrate_all` on VPS after deploy** — new tables must exist before code uses them

## [1.18.0] — 2026-04-06 — AI Conversation Manager

### Added
- **AI conversation manager** — Groq-powered natural conversation replaces "I didn't understand" dead-ends
- **Correction detection** — "no, name is X" during confirm steps updates the field instead of cancelling
- **Chat history context** — all messages saved to chat_messages, fed to Groq for multi-turn understanding
- **CONVERSATION_MANAGER_PROMPT** — new prompt in prompts.py for corrections, clarifications, natural chat
- **manage_conversation()** — new ClaudeClient method returns structured {action, entities, correction, reply}
- **Stress test suite** — 194 test cases across 16 intent groups, 100% pass rate

### Fixed
- **Intent disambiguation** — precise descriptions for CHECKOUT vs NOTICE_GIVEN, QUERY_TENANT vs ROOM_STATUS, ADD_TENANT vs START_ONBOARDING, CHECKOUT vs RECORD_CHECKOUT
- **UNKNOWN passthrough** — removed from LOW_CONF_PASSTHROUGH so all unknowns hit AI conversation manager
- "Priya is leaving" now correctly routes to CHECKOUT (was NOTICE_GIVEN)
- "room 203 details" now correctly routes to QUERY_TENANT (was ROOM_STATUS)
- "register tenant Arun" now correctly routes to ADD_TENANT (was START_ONBOARDING)
- "thats wrong start over" now correctly routes to CANCEL (was ASK_WHAT_TO_CHANGE)

## [1.17.0] — 2026-04-06 — Full Data Sync + Add Tenant KYC + Dashboard

### Added
- **Add Tenant form** — 14 new KYC fields (DOB, father, address, email, occupation, emergency contact, ID proof) — all skippable with "skip all" shortcut
- **Change Checkout Date** — new intent UPDATE_CHECKOUT_DATE with handler
- **Lokesh receptionist** — added to authorized_users (7680814628)
- **Apps Script dashboard web app** — Code.gs + Index.html, reads from monthly tabs
- **Anomaly report** — 93 items uploaded to ANOMALY REPORT tab in Google Sheet
- **Cheat sheets** — full command reference + printable workflow guide
- **Dependency sync rule** — 13-point checklist added to CLAUDE.md

### Fixed
- **Excel column mapping** — April column (col 28) shifted Feb/March Balance/Cash/UPI by 1 position
- **Entity extraction** — "What is the rent for chinmay" now correctly extracts name (was grabbing "What")
- **Month extraction** — word boundary prevents "chinmay" matching month "may"
- **Exit text pattern** — "april 3rd 7am exit" no longer parsed as balance=3
- **TENANTS tab** — expanded to 32 columns (Notes, Food, Staff, KYC fields)
- **April tab** — uses Excel April column (col 28) when available
- **Overpayment analysis** — accounts for rent+deposit and Feb balance (reduced false positives from 69 to 0)
- **Apps Script** — case-insensitive tab matching, month-on-month row expansion, error handling

### Data
- Full Excel reimport: 291 tenants, 292 tenancies, 1009 payments, 1033 rent_schedule rows
- March verified: Cash 1,030,220 + UPI 2,667,888 — matches manual count
- 3 Hitachi tenants fixed in DB (Sachin, Pankaj, Himanshu — rent 23,850)

## [1.16.0] — 2026-04-05 — Image-Based Check-in + Haiku Intent Fallback

### Added
- **Image-based tenant check-in** — upload registration form photo, Claude Haiku extracts all fields
- **form_extractor.py** — vision extraction with training data collection for future Groq fine-tuning
- **Interactive edit flow** — "edit name Kanchan Sharma" to correct any extracted field
- **Room validation on check-in** — full rooms show occupants with checkout option ("1 today")
- **Gender mismatch warning** — warns when adding male tenant to female-occupied room
- **Sharing type confirmation** — asks double/premium for multi-bed rooms
- **Document collection flow** — after check-in, collects ID proofs + signed rules page
- **15 new TENANTS Sheet columns** — DOB, father, address, emergency, email, occupation, education, office, ID proof, food, notes
- **3 new DB columns** — educational_qualification, office_address, office_phone
- **New DocumentTypes** — reg_form, rules_page (archived per tenant)
- **Duplicate-log prevention** — message after successful log treated as query, not re-log
- **Claude Haiku as intent fallback** — replaces Groq for UNKNOWN intents (much better accuracy)
- **Expanded intent list** — complaints, vacation, room status, expense queries now recognized
- **38 edge case tests** for the full check-in flow

### Changed
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY now used for two features: form extraction + intent fallback
- Intent detection falls back to Haiku (~$0.0005/call) instead of Groq for unrecognized messages
- ADD_TENANT prompt now offers image upload option

### Added (continued — same session)
- **Checkout form extraction** — photo upload extracts name, room, date, refund details, verification checklist
- **Refund Amount column** in Sheet (col 17, KYC shifted to 18-32)
- **Receipt slip archiving** — auto-prompts after payment confirm AND checkout refund
- **COLLECT_RECEIPT handler** — saves receipt photos tagged to tenant/payment
- **Image + expense keyword routing** — photo with "EB bill" always routes to ADD_EXPENSE
- **"log EB bill" regex fix** — routes to ADD_EXPENSE instead of ACTIVITY_LOG
- **_save_pending import fix** in LOG_EXPENSE_STEP handler
- **"eb" alone** maps to electricity category (no need for "eb bill")

### Architecture
- Haiku vision: called once per form photo (check-in or checkout), no API for edits
- Haiku intent fallback: called only for UNKNOWN intents (~$0.0005/call)
- Training pairs saved to data/form_training/ for future Groq fine-tuning
- All documents tagged to tenant_id/tenancy_id in documents table
- Receipt slips saved under data/documents/receipts/YYYY-MM/

## [1.15.0] — 2026-04-02/03 — Reminder System + Payment Flow Fixes + Sheet Sync

### Added
- **Reminder system via official WhatsApp number** — 85488 84466 sends template-based rent reminders
- **`src/whatsapp/reminder_sender.py`** — template + text sending, auto-fallback to bot number
- **`src/api/reminder_router.py`** — endpoints: preview-rent, preview-all-tenants, blast-rent-reminder, send-custom, send-bulk
- **Meta Message Templates** — `rent_reminder` and `general_notice` approved and working
- **GSheets void_payment()** — voids now sync to Sheet (subtract amount, update status/notes)
- **Void payment picker** — when no current month payment, shows list of recent payments to choose from
- **CONFIRM_PAYMENT_ALLOC mode correction** — replies like "upi" or "no she paid upi" now update payment mode

### Fixed
- **GSheets payment write-back was broken** — `ctx.name` → `ctx_name` (every bot payment was silently failing)
- **GSheets method validation** — `Cash` rejected, now lowercased before validation
- **Excel import silently skipping tenants** — missing room → UNASSIGNED, missing date → fallback
- **Payment mode defaulting to CASH** — no longer hardcoded, uses explicit fallback
- **"Suggested allocation" noise** — single-month payments now show simple confirmation
- **Void defaulting to most recent payment** — now defaults to current month, prevents accidental old-month voids

### Architecture
- Two WhatsApp numbers: +1 55 (bot) + 84466 (official, reminders only)
- 84455 remains regular WhatsApp Business app for manual chatting
- Scheduler sends reminders on 1st/15th via official number when configured

### Config
- New env vars: `REMINDER_WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `REMINDER_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`

## [1.14.0] — 2026-04-01 — Sheet Dashboard Auto-Refresh + Full April Reload

### Fixed
- **Sheet dashboard not auto-updating** — Apps Script `onEdit` doesn't fire on API writes. Added `_refresh_summary_sync()` in gsheets.py that recalculates per-row Total Paid, Balance, Status AND summary rows 2-3 after every bot write.
- **Previous month dues not carried forward** — APRIL 2026 was in old 15-column format without Prev Due column. Upgraded to new 17-column format with Phone, Prev Due, Entered By.
- **No-shows missing from April** — reload script was excluding NO SHOW entries. Fixed to include April no-shows (18 total).
- **Stale NO-SHOW events** — tenants who changed from NO SHOW to CHECKIN in Excel kept stale NO-SHOW event in sheet. Excel now overrides.
- **Missing tenants in TENANTS master** — 14 tenants added (new bookings, no-shows with empty IN/OUT).

### Added
- **`_refresh_summary_sync()`** — Python-side mirror of Apps Script `updateMonthSummary`. Per-row recalc + summary rows. Called after payment, add_tenant, checkout, notice.
- **Entered By column (Q)** — audit trail showing who logged each payment (from `ctx.name` in WhatsApp handler).
- **Notes carry-forward** — permanent DB comments + March notes loaded into April Notes column. Apps Script `createMonthTab` updated to carry forward prev month notes when dues exist.
- **`scripts/reload_april.py`** — full reload script: Excel + DB notes + March Sheet + existing payments → 17-column April tab.
- **DB payment reader** in reload script — ensures real payments survive reloads.

### Changed
- Monthly tab format: 15 → 17 columns (added Phone, Prev Due, Entered By)
- Apps Script `createMonthTab`: 16 → 17 columns, notes carry-forward
- Apps Script summary rows: lastCol P → Q

### Sheet State (April 2026)
- 225 rows (207 checked-in + 18 no-show)
- 225 beds occupied (189 regular + 18 premium × 2)
- 48 vacant, 77.3% occupancy
- 25 tenants with prev dues from March
- 106 tenants with permanent notes

### Files changed
gsheets.py, account_handler.py, gsheet_apps_script.js, reload_april.py (new)

---

## [1.13.0] — 2026-04-01 — Overpayment Fix + Role Simplification

### Fixed
- **Overpayment false positive** — payment was added to session before `prev_paid` query, causing double-counting on first payment of a new month (when rent_schedule auto-generates + flushes). Moved payment creation after prev_paid query.
- **Golden test leaks** — updated "Artha" bot name references to "Cozeevo" in test suite (G091, G097, G098)
- **Receptionist migration** — fixed `_add_receptionist_role` in migrate_all.py (was using wrong enum type name `user_role` instead of `userrole`)

### Changed
- **Simplified to 3 roles:** admin (Kiran — full L0 access), owner (Lakshmi, Prabhakaran — all except L0), receptionist (Sathyam — payments + queries, no financial reports/expenses/voids/refunds)
- **Removed** `power_user` and `key_user` roles from enum, all code, and DB
- **Removed** test users (TestKeyUser, Test Receptionist) from authorized_users
- **Expanded receptionist blocked list:** REPORT, BANK_REPORT, BANK_DEPOSIT_MATCH, QUERY_EXPENSES, ADD_EXPENSE, VOID_EXPENSE, ADD_REFUND, QUERY_REFUNDS, VOID_PAYMENT, RENT_CHANGE, RENT_DISCOUNT

### Files changed (15)
account_handler, gatekeeper, models, role_service, intent_detector, chat_api, _shared, webhook_handler, claude_client, scheduler, v2/chat_api_v2, v2/supervisor, owner_handler, migrate_all, seed

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-03-31 — Bug Fixes, Corrections, Receptionist Test Suite

### Fixed
- **Payment confirmation crash** — `UnboundLocalError` on `_do_log_payment_by_ids` in `resolve_pending_action` (lazy import fix)
- **"paied" typo** not matching PAYMENT_LOG intent
- **"pending dues"** not matching QUERY_DUES intent

### Added
- **Month correction mid-flow** — "no for february", "no january" during payment confirmation
- **Amount+month combo correction** — "no 14000 for february" during payment confirmation
- **Hindi affirmative keywords** — "theek hai", "thik hai", "sahi hai" now recognized as confirmation
- **Sathyam (7993273966)** added as receptionist in authorized_users + staff table
- **8548884455 (Business Number)** added as admin in authorized_users
- **Prabhakaran (9444296681)** added to Meta WhatsApp test number list
- **102-case E2E receptionist test suite** (96/102 passing)
- **25-case correction workflow test suite** (25/25 passing)
- **Bank P&L report** — `scripts/full_pnl_view.py` for investment vs operating expense breakdown

### Diagnosed
- **Prabhakaran bot not responding** — Meta error 131030 (recipient not in allowed list). App still uses test number (+1 555 192 0467), not real business number. Messages reach bot but replies blocked by Meta.

---

## [1.11.0] — 2026-03-30 — Payment Flow Rework + Notes Architecture + Doc Consolidation

### Added
- **Payment dues snapshot** — both quick payment ("Raj paid 8000 cash") and step-by-step ("collect rent") now show full dues breakdown (per-month amounts, status, notes) before confirmation
- **Smart month allocation** — oldest-first allocation when tenant owes across multiple months, receptionist can override ("all to march" or "feb 3000 march 5000")
- **Two-tier notes system** — `tenancy.notes` (permanent agreements) + `rent_schedule.notes` (monthly status), both synced to DB + Google Sheet with retry (3 attempts)
- **Notes carry-over** — monthly notes auto-copied to next month's rent_schedule when generated
- **UPDATE_TENANT_NOTES intent** — separate workflow to edit permanent tenant notes ("update agreement for Raj")
- **Import reclassification** — `--preview-notes` flag on excel_import to classify Excel comments as permanent/monthly/ambiguous before import
- **5 new workflow tests** — payment snapshot, allocation confirm/cancel, collect rent snapshot, tenant notes CRUD

### Changed
- **Doc consolidation** — 20 docs → 12 (8 core + 4 planning/business). Merged ARCHITECTURE.md + SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md into BRAIN.md. Merged DATA_STRATEGY.md into EXCEL_IMPORT.md. Moved PRICING/PRD/ROADMAP/FINANCIAL_VISION to subfolders.
- **BRAIN.md accuracy fixes** — table count 21→26, beds ~295→291, staff rooms 8→9, n8n references removed

### Fixed
- **rent_schedule auto-generation** — when payment logged for month without rent_schedule, row is now created with carry-over notes from previous month

---

## [1.10.0] — 2026-03-29 — Workflow Enhancements + 30 Tests

### Added
- **ADD_TENANT: food_preference step** — veg/non-veg/egg asked after gender, saved to DB
- **CHECKOUT: exit date collection** — receptionist enters actual exit date (was hardcoded to today)
- **CHECKOUT: deposit forfeiture** — notice after 5th = deposit forfeited with clear message to receptionist
- **LOG_EXPENSE: receipt photo** — asks for photo after description, allows skip
- **NOTICE QUERY: enhanced** — shows count, deposit/refund per tenant, forfeiture status
- **Intent: "how many notices"** — routes to QUERY_EXPIRING
- **30 workflow tests** — tests/test_workflow_flows.py covering all flows with edge cases

### Fixed
- **Payment+month intent clash** — "Raj paid 15000 upi march" now routes to PAYMENT_LOG (was REPORT)
- **Checkout Sheet update** — exit date passed to Google Sheet (was always today)
- **Media fields in pending** — media_id/type/mime now passed through resolve_pending_action

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-03-29 — Excel Import Pipeline + Onboarding + Doc Cleanup

### Added
- **Excel import pipeline** — single parser (`clean_and_load.py :: read_history()`), DB import calls it. 283/283 rows, 0 skipped. DB == Sheet financials verified.
- **Onboarding system** — media intake (ID photo + selfie), admin approval flow (yes/no), food preference step, 15 steps total.
- **Deposit tracking** — ask advance paid, show remaining balance in tenant queries.
- **Smart activity/expense queries** — Groq-powered natural language answers from logs and expense records.
- **April tab** — with formulas (Total Paid = Cash+UPI, Balance = Rent-Paid, Status = IF).
- **Gender-based bed search** — find rooms with female/male occupant + empty bed.
- **Monthly/yearly reports** — cash/UPI/expenses/deposits breakdown + vacant beds by building.
- **Help menu** — example queries for every service.
- **Receptionist cheat sheet** — `docs/RECEPTIONIST_CHEAT_SHEET.md`.
- **1519 unit tests** — all passing.

### Fixed
- **No-show logic** — appear in EVERY month until checkin (was only checkin month). Per-month bed count.
- **Room lookup** — DB building is truth, Excel BLOCK ignored. UNASSIGNED dummy room for May no-shows.
- **Payment extraction** — uses `clean_num()` not `sn()`, handles messy cells like `19500/6500`.
- **Payments without rent status** — created even when rent status column is blank.
- **Name search precision** — exact first-word match before substring (Arun no longer matches Tarun).
- **Phone normalization** — +91 mismatch between pending and ctx.phone in onboarding approval.

### Docs
- Deleted stale: QUICKSTART.md, SHEET_WORKFLOW.md
- Removed n8n refs from DEPLOYMENT.md, SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
- Created `docs/EXCEL_IMPORT.md` — single workflow doc for Excel → Sheet → DB
- Updated CLAUDE.md — current architecture, data flow, docs index, end-of-day checklist
- Created global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — behavioral rules for all projects

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-03-15 — VPS Live + Bot Improvements

### Deployed
- **Bot live on VPS** — Hostinger KVM 1 (187.127.130.194). Domain: `api.getkozzy.com`. nginx reverse proxy. SSL via Let's Encrypt. systemd service `pg-accountant` (auto-restart).
- **LLM switched from Ollama → Groq** — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (cloud, free). n8n skipped entirely — Meta webhooks go directly to nginx → FastAPI.
- **Permanent WhatsApp token** — updated in `/opt/pg-accountant/.env`.

### Added
- **Bot identity: Artha** — `BOT_NAME = "Artha"` in `_shared.py`. First-time users get full intro. Returning users get short tagline every greeting.
- **Time-based greetings (IST)** — `time_greeting()`: Good morning (5–12), Good afternoon (12–17), Good evening (17+). "Good night" removed — night is a farewell only.
- **WiFi password intent** — `GET_WIFI_PASSWORD` + `SET_WIFI` intents. Tenants see floor-specific WiFi. Owners see all. Leads blocked.
- **WiFi data seeded** — `src/database/seed_wifi.py` stores full Thor + Hulk WiFi credentials in `properties.wifi_floor_map` JSONB. Thor: G/1–6/TOP/WS/GYM. Hulk: G/1–6.
- **Expense category auto-extraction** — `intent_detector._extract_entities()` extracts `category` from message for `ADD_EXPENSE` intent (electricity, water, internet, salary, plumbing, groceries, diesel, cleaning, security).

### Fixed
- `seed_wifi.py`: corrected import to use `get_session` + `init_engine`.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-14 — Accounting & P&L Scripts

### Added
- `scripts/bank_statement_extractor.py` — PDF bank statement extractor using word-coordinate layout parsing (fixes pdfplumber multi-line cell bug). Extracts transactions with UPI metadata: UTR, payer/payee UPI IDs, transaction type, keyword-based category. Outputs enriched Excel.
- `scripts/pnl_report.py` — Month-by-month P&L classifier. Keyword-based `EXPENSE_RULES` (15 categories, 100+ sub-rules) + `INCOME_RULES`. `MANUAL_ENTRIES` / `MANUAL_INCOME_ENTRIES` stubs for confirmed manual additions. Outputs `PnL_Report.xlsx` (Dec 2025–Mar 2026).
- `scripts/check_others.py` — Diagnostic: lists all unclassified transactions (Other Expenses) so owner can review and reclassify.
- `scripts/simple_pnl.py` — Lightweight P&L export (same rules, no formatting).
- `scripts/detailed_expense_report.py`, `scripts/export_salary_to_excel.py`, `scripts/validate_jan.py` — supporting utilities.

### Classification Rules Established
- `chandan865858` UPI → Maintenance & Repairs / Plumbing
- `sunilgn8834@okaxis` / "Dg rent" → Fuel & Diesel / DG Rent Generator (not Property Rent)
- Bharathi RTGS Rs 5L → Advance / Recoverable (recoverable hand loan, not an operating expense)
- Sri Lakshmi Chandrasekhar keyword tightened to `"lakshmi chandrasekhar"` — prevents `chandrasekhar1996krish` UPI payments being misclassified as Property Rent
- `MANUAL_ENTRIES = []` — never populated by assumption; only add with user-confirmed exact amounts

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **`rooms.is_charged` + `rooms.is_staff_room` columns** (`models.py`): G05/G06 (THOR) marked `is_charged=False` (building owner gives free). Staff rooms excluded from tenant occupancy/vacancy counts.
- **Canonical room migration** (`src/database/migrate_rooms.py`): Upserts 166 canonical rooms across THOR + HULK. Deactivates non-canonical Room records from old Excel import.
- **Deposit tracking end-to-end**: `refunds` table now actively used. `RECORD_CHECKOUT` creates `Refund(status=pending)` on form completion. Staff confirms via WhatsApp "process" reply.
- **`CONFIRM_DEPOSIT_REFUND` intent** (`owner_handler.py`): Handles staff reply to checkout alert. Supports `process`, `deduct XXXX`, `deduct XXXX process`. Creates `Refund(status=processed)` + updates `CheckoutRecord.deposit_refunded_amount`.
- **Daily 9am checkout alert job** (`src/scheduler.py`): `_checkout_deposit_alerts()` — scans for `expected_checkout = today`, calculates deposit held + outstanding dues, sends settlement summary to assigned staff + all admin/power_user phones, creates `PendingAction(CONFIRM_DEPOSIT_REFUND)` per recipient.
- **Data verification scripts** (`scripts/`):
  - `occupancy_today.py` — current bed/room snapshot with THOR/HULK breakdown and occupancy %
  - `empty_rooms.py` — floor-wise empty/partial/full rooms, no-show bookings, exports CSV
  - `payment_breakdown.py` — payments by mode (cash/UPI/bank/cheque) and for_type (rent/deposit/booking)
  - `deposit_check.py` — 4 views: deposits received in period, by checkin date, total held, advance deposits

### Fixed
- **`resolve_pending_action` structural bug** (`owner_handler.py`): `RECORD_CHECKOUT` Q2–Q5 text-reply steps (yes/no/amount) were unreachable — function returned `None` before the step code. Fixed by moving all multi-step text flows before the numeric-choice guard.
- **17 future no_show tenancies** corrected to `active` — they had future checkin dates and paid deposits, not real no-shows.

### Changed
- `src/scheduler.py`: 4 → 5 jobs. New `checkout_deposit_alerts` runs at 09:00 IST daily.
- Net deposit formula: `SUM(payments.amount WHERE for_type='deposit') - SUM(refunds.amount WHERE status='processed')` = deposits currently held as liability.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **`src/whatsapp/gatekeeper.py`**: Smart router — maps `(role, intent)` → correct worker. Replaces flat `if role == "admin"` chain in `chat_api.py`. Owner-role users go to AccountWorker for financial intents, OwnerWorker for operational.
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/account_handler.py`** (1,058 lines): AccountWorker — dedicated accounting persona. Owns 11 financial intents: `PAYMENT_LOG`, `QUERY_DUES`, `QUERY_TENANT`, `ADD_EXPENSE`, `QUERY_EXPENSES`, `REPORT`, `RENT_CHANGE`, `RENT_DISCOUNT`, `VOID_PAYMENT`, `ADD_REFUND`, `QUERY_REFUNDS`. Uses `Rs.` prefix, full due/paid/balance breakdowns, `property_logic.py` for all math.
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/_shared.py`** (212 lines): 8 shared DB helpers used by both workers: fuzzy tenant search, disambiguation, room overlap check, pending action save. Extracted verbatim from owner_handler — zero logic change.

### Changed
- **`src/whatsapp/handlers/owner_handler.py`**: 2,595 → 1,434 lines. Financial handlers moved to `account_handler.py`. Shared helpers moved to `_shared.py`. Now operational intents only. Imports `_do_*` functions back from account_handler for `resolve_pending_action`.
- **`src/whatsapp/chat_api.py`**: 3-branch routing block replaced with single `reply = await route(intent, intent_result.entities, ctx, message, session)`.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **`investment_expenses` table** (`models.py`, `migrate_investment_data.py`): L0 permanent table. 131 rows imported from "White Field PG Expenses" consolidated sheet. Tracks Whitefield PG setup/construction spending by investor (Chandrasekhar, Prabhakaran, Jitendra, Ashokan, Narendra, Kiran Kumar). Total: Rs 2.05 Cr. Dedup via SHA-256(sno+purpose+amount+paid_by). Individual person sheets (ASHOKAN/JITENDRA/NARENDRA/OUR SIDE) skipped — they are subsets of the consolidated sheet.
- **`pg_contacts` table** (`models.py`, `migrate_investment_data.py`): L0 permanent table. 62 contacts imported from Contacts.xlsx. Owner+staff visible only (not accessible to tenants/leads). Auto-categorized into 17 categories (plumber, electrician, carpenter, furniture, food_supply, decor, etc.). Dedup via SHA-256(name+phone+contact_for).
- **Migration + import script** (`src/database/migrate_investment_data.py`): Single idempotent script — creates both tables and imports from both Excel files. Safe to re-run: ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING on unique_hash.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **PAN Card ID proof** (`tenant_handler.py`): Added PAN Card, Voter ID, Ration Card as accepted ID proof types alongside Aadhar/Passport/Driving License.
- **Extended onboarding — 12 steps** (`tenant_handler.py`): Registration form fully digitized. New steps: DOB, father name, father phone, home address, email (skippable), occupation (skippable), emergency relationship. Total: 12 questions matching physical Cozeevo registration form.
- **7 new Tenant columns** (`models.py` + migrated): `father_name`, `father_phone`, `date_of_birth`, `permanent_address`, `email`, `occupation`, `emergency_contact_relationship`. All live in Supabase.
- **RULES intent** (`intent_detector.py`, `tenant_handler.py`, `owner_handler.py`): All 19 PG rules from the physical document. Available to tenants and owners. Trigger: "rules", "regulations", "pg rules", "house rules", "policy".
- **Master migration script** (`src/database/migrate_all.py`): Single idempotent script for all scenarios. Flags: `--seed` (add baseline data), `--status` (read-only check).
- **Data strategy guide** (`DATA_STRATEGY.md`): Documents load strategy for 6 scenarios — fresh install, test->prod, new PG customer, delta load, test reset, seed fix. Includes anti-duplicate guarantee table and pre-deployment checklist.

### Changed
- `tenant_handler._ONBOARDING_QUESTIONS`: Updated `ask_id_type` prompt to show all 4 options.
- `owner_handler._help`: Updated menu to show onboarding + checkout + rules commands.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Phone normalization** (`role_service._normalize`): WhatsApp sends `+917845952289`, DB stores `7845952289`. Strips `+91`/`91` prefix for Indian 10-digit numbers automatically.
- **Hot water / plumbing keywords** (`tenant_handler.py`): `hot water`, `geyser`, `heater`, `shower` now map to `plumbing` complaint category.
- **Complaint description passthrough** (`chat_api.py`): Raw message injected into `entities["description"]` before routing so complaint text reaches handlers instead of generic placeholder.
- **START_ONBOARDING intent** (`intent_detector.py`): Owner triggers "start onboarding for [name] [number]" → creates tenant record + OnboardingSession with 48-hour TTL.
- **Tenant KYC onboarding flow** (`tenant_handler.py`, `chat_api.py`): Step-by-step WhatsApp form: gender → emergency contact name → emergency contact phone → ID type → ID number. Data saved to `Tenant` record on completion.
- **RECORD_CHECKOUT intent** (`intent_detector.py`): Owner triggers checkout form via "record checkout", "offboard", "keys returned", etc.
- **Offboarding checklist flow** (`owner_handler.py`): Multi-step form: cupboard key → main key → damage notes → pending dues → deposit refund amount + date. Creates `CheckoutRecord`, marks `Tenancy.status = exited`.
- **OnboardingSession ORM model** (`models.py`): New L3 table `onboarding_sessions` — step-based JSON state machine, 48-hour TTL, foreign key to tenants + tenancies.
- **CheckoutRecord ORM model** (`models.py`): New L3 table `checkout_records` — captures key returns, damages, dues, deposit refund date, exit date.
- **Migration script** (`src/database/migrate_onboarding_checkout.py`): Creates both new tables. **Already run successfully.**

### Changed
- `role_service._normalize()` rewritten to correctly handle all Indian phone format variants.
- `intent_detector._OWNER_RULES`: `START_ONBOARDING` and `RECORD_CHECKOUT` added at top (highest priority).
- `owner_handler.resolve_pending_action()`: Extended to handle `RECORD_CHECKOUT` multi-step flow.
- `chat_api.py`: Added step 2a — checks active `OnboardingSession` before normal intent detection, intercepting onboarding answers correctly.
